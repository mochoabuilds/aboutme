		<h2> ARE JUDGES POLITICAL?: AN EMPRICIAL ANALYSIS OF THE FEDERAL COURTS OF APPEALS </h2>

		<p>It is easy to be a judge when there is a case or statue on point; you follow it.  But the reality is very often there is not a specific case or statue to follow, or the parties couldn't agree and they choose to rely on a judge for the answer, and so the matter is left to the judge's discretion to decide.  Deciding an issue where the fact and the law are opaque is what makes judging difficult.  In such cases the political leanings of judges play a role.</p>

		<p>To illustrate, it is easily imaginable that like-minded judges, unaccompanied by a dissenter, may fail to apply the law as they should.  For when the law is opaque the social psychology of humans may take over to understand the law in way that fits their convictions, commitments and political leanings.  While there is no right answer in the law; the matters that call for a judge to decide an issue where the law is opaque shouldn't have judges simply vote by party or ideological lines.  For that reason some worry that the ideals and virtues of judges are fading - those being a delicate mix of logic tempered by practical wisdom, reflection and imagination; an honest listening of the competing arguments in a case.  And as this fade happens, will the ability of judges to provide sound political leadership fade too? </p>

		<p>	The best defense is for the courts, which encompasses the judiciary, its staff and technological resources, to do their job well â€“ that is, articulate well-reasoned persuasive explanations for their decisions.  Such defense protects the courts from serving up offensive judgment deprived of persuasion and reasoning, consistency and principle, the kind of political leanings that destroy our faith in the judicial branch of government.  Thankfully the process of legal training imposes strong limits on what judges can do.  As do the disrupting effects of precedent and rule of law means there is often not too much break from the ideals and virtues.  This political culture ensures judges do not simply vote their political convictions.</p>

		<p>We believe the challenge of this century will be to construct, for the society that is emerging, institutions and laws that ensure judges continue to meet these ideals and virtues. Courts bear the tremendous responsibility of sustaining our political order midst the profound moral and political differences that divide us.  Some would call it an experiment in reworking social order against the flows of history and prejudice, a seesaw of remedies and resistance.  Thankfully most of the time, the law is what matters, not party, ideology or social psychology.  But does federal judicial voting data sometimes not reflect a real tribute to the law?  Are there areas of emerging law that show a pattern of judicial ideals and virtues fading?  And who is gauging whether our system of justice is meeting these ideals and virtues?</p>

		<p>While empirical models of judicial decisions making is not new to judicial literature.  We believe many exciting opportunities exist to develop and test the forces by which economic-social-psychological factors affect judicial behavior.  We understand the sensitive nature of our questions and the strongly opposing views and deep convictions it may inspire.  However a court unrestrained by the discipline of virtues, ideals and legal reasoning only invites additional illegitimacy to its doorstep.</p>

<h2>Nooz</h2>
<p> We designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story. I engaged psychology and art history to build a business model and marketing plan around my undergraduate research.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
