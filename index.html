		<h2>HOW NEWSPAPER COVERAGE INFLUENCED JUDICIAL OPINION DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC (AND HOW “PERSONALIZED RULE” COULD ADVANCE THE LAW) 
		</h2>

		<p>Imagine you are a judge.  How do you reach decisions?  It's easy when there is a law, statute or precedent on point;  you follow it.  But what happens when the law is unclear or in flux?  As a judge you provide judgment based on logic and reasoning, not personal choice.  Your judicial restraint – solidified by years of legal training and the rule of law – imposes strong limits on decisions and ensures your personal choice doesn't dominate considerations of law, statute or precedent.  
		</p>

		<p>We study what influenced judges to reach the decisions they did during the COVID-19 pandemic.  We assert the following hypotheses: (i) pandemic media coverage increased cross-partisan judicial opinion; (ii) this effect is larger for non-partisan elected judges than partisan elected judges.  We explore these hypotheses using data on #### judicial opinions between YYYY and YYYY.  We combine this data from ### newspapers covering #### trial court judges during YYYY and YYYY.  Preparing these statistics allows us to scrape off the barnacles with which the bench is encrusted with and test our hypotheses.
		</p>

		<p>To put this argument in perspective let's consider the game of baseball.  Within this past time different umpires define the “strike-zone” differently, so players adjust their tactics to a particular umpire, much like how judges interpret cases, statues and precedents differently.  We argue, as a way of counteracting  thoughts of mortality stemming from media coverage of the pandemic judges moved their judicial “strike-zone” to affirm the fundamental rules governing a stable society, even if it meant crossing partisan lines. 
		</p>

		<p>No one can deny that the pandemic was momentous.  It shaped what what was litigated and what wasn't and the academic scrutiny under which judges operate.  Historically speaking, scholars often scrutinize the way judges are politically motivated or biased.  This focus on judicial failings makes them seem worse than they are.  Our essay explores what circumstances influenced judges to deviate from their pre-pandemic selves, and affirm the fundamental rules governing a stable society, ultimately bringing the law closer to the public's sense of justice..</p>

<h2>Nooz</h2>
<p> We designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story. I engaged psychology and art history to build a business model and marketing plan around my undergraduate research.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
