		<h2>who will distribute cbdc?</h2>

		<h3>Changeups in technology have slowed the flow of cold hard cash. To counter this declining use of cash central banks around the world have developed their own digital currency akin to cash. However this modernization requires each nation's central bank to absorb and translate needs that are highly dependent on local norms, know-how and individuals. Talk about building the plane as you fly it.</h3>

		<h3>At the heart of my research is defining the role of whomever distributes the central bank digital currency (cbdc). It is a significant role as a distributor will have an outsized influence in how cbdc evolves "closer to the ground". Distributors will: handle individual level transcations, opening accounts, allowing individuals to exchange fiat currency for cbdc, submitting and processing transactions to central bank systems and more. Such features will give a distributor clear ownership and representation in money, banking and payments.  By developing frameworks and scenarios that central banks can use to evaluate their desired goals we can see how best to meet today's tech requirements - and tomorrow's - policy goals.  Ultimately, the goal is to show central banks how essential retailers could be a trusted distributor for allocating and managing cbcd "closer to the ground".

		<h3>Future research is focused on harmonizing online and offline payments (i.e. no wifi, no power). Ensuring this offline resiliency is the mission. </h3>
