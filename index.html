		<h2>LEGAL ORIGINS EFFECT ON FINANCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND INVESTOR PROECTIONS WITHIN CAPITAL MARKETS: A SURVEY OF ## COUNTRIES
		</h2>

		<p>Imagine you are an investor in France.  As a shareholder or creditor you are entitled to a very different bundle of legal rights than someone in Britain or Taiwan.  Law differs greatly around the world.  A large part of this variation stems from a country's legal origin (e.g. the original structures of the laws a country adopts).  We argue that capital markets value is created by its legal origins. 
		</p>

		<p>Surprisingly, it turns out that few scholars have considered how a country's legal origins effect on financial accountability and investor protections within developing capital markets.  The fact that most countries inherit significant parts of their legal procedures – often involuntarily – is important for our analysis.  At the econometric level, it suggests that legal origin can be used as an instrument for measuring the degree of formalism – that is, the quality of financial accountability and investor protections in different countries.  
		</p>

		<p>Our formalism index combs legal procedures and balance sheets in order to rate the legitimacy of developing capital markets by their legal origin.  This enables us to establish two hypotheses.  If countries select their legal procedures voluntarily, then one can argue that greater formalism led to greater capital market development and financial accountability during the pandemic.  However, if legal procedures come thru colonization or conquest, the efficient adoption model does not apply.  
		</p>

		<p>Our empirical research shows that legal origins effect on legal procedures has unexpectedly made the task of ensuring financial accountability and investor protections more daunting within some capital markets.  To accomplish this comparative analysis we assembled a data set of accounting practices and investor protections between YYYY-YYYY in ## countries that have publicly traded companies.  Exploring how our formalism index differs among countries allows us to ask, whether, in a statistical sense, legal origin effects financial accountability and investor protections, and whether these differences had large effects on the size, breadth and valuation of developing capital markets during the pandemic.
		</p>

		<p>While such material has long circulated quietly.  What our paper does is redefine the substance of the debate.  We ask whether the good stewardship of developing capital markets is tied to legal origins.  The idea is to show how capital markets develop better when accounting and investor protections are seen not simply as part of a financial transaction but also as part of a moral and cultural framework of capital markets. 
		</p>

		<p>Our paper explores the characteristics of capital markets that have enjoyed or appear ripe for long lasting success.  We believe these society's are not only rich in their accounting cultures and investor protections but have tried to construct sound moral and cultural frameworks as humans have a habit of not doing accounting well.  Our paper explores why a lesson so simple is repeatably ignored.

<h2>Nooz</h2>
<p>I led a group of computer engineering, architecture and graphic design students on a machine learning project. Our project was supported by grants from two universities. We designed mobile software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure 
index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more 
personal quality to a breaking news story. Seed Funding Perkins Coie LLP </p>
