		<h2>INSIDE A JUDGE'S MIND:  HOW THOUGHTS OF MORTALITY AND ITS EFFECT ON JUDICIAL SELF-INTEREST POLITICIZED THE BENCH DURING COVID-19 (AND HOW 'PERSONALIZED RULE' COULD IMPROVE THE LAW)

		</h2>

		<p>Imagine you are a judge...  It's easy when there is a law,  statute or precedent on point; you follow it.  But what do you do when new activity emerges and the rights and duties of the people engaged are unclear?  In dealing with these hard questions you cast judgment not on the basis of personal choice, but logic and analogical reasoning.  But given the vastness of law and its extension into all sorts of controversial areas it's inevitable some of your decisions will be based on personal choice.  Thankfully the rule of law and your legal training imposes strong limits on what you can do.  You can't simply vote based on personal choice and politicize the bench.  This is what makes the law work.  This essay explore what makes the law not work. 
		</p>

		<p>To show what makes the law not work let's continue imagining you are a judge... During the pandemic each morning you awoke to media reports reminding you of death.  We argue that daily reminders of  death motivated you to invest and defend your cultural worldviews where the law is unclear or in flux.  Our essay seeks to understand the role of bias induced by thoughts of mortality influence judicial decision making.
		</p>

		<p>To accomplish this we complied a large and publicly available data set, consisting of numerous judicial votes and opinions in many different areas of the law.  Our initial goal is to examine three hypotheses: (1) the role of bias created by thoughts of mortality in judicial decision making; (2) the rise of commonalities and differences across partisan lines, created by thoughts of mortality; (3) whether judges are likely to be influenced by thoughts of mortality when they have been on the bench for an extended period or when they are newly appointed.  Our goal is to present and analyze the data â€“ and show how our hypotheses find vindication, and relate them to continuing debates about how deeply rooted concerns with mortality influence legal decision making. 
		</p>

		<p>Surprisingly, few scholars have considered how thoughts of mortality influenced judicial decision making during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Our basic claim shows how deeply rooted concerns with mortality have unexpectedly led to judges deviating from precedent to affirm their cultural worldviews, thus politicizing the bench.  Viewing this event from an economic perspective leads us to conclude the bench is too political and should be extended to include the experimental legal paradigm of 'personalized rule'.

<h2>Nooz</h2>
<p> We designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story. I engaged psychology and art history to build a business model and marketing plan around my undergraduate research.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
