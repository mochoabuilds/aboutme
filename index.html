		<h2>offline payments using cbdc</h2>

		<h3>A changeup in technology has slowed the flow of cold hard cash. Payments now largely flow digitally and act as the financial systems oxygen.  When it flows freely, it does so unnoticed.  But when it stops, everything seems to as well. </h3>

		<h3>However, there's a societal risk that comes when the financial systems oxygen stops flowing. To mitigate this risk we must radically elevate essential retailers ownership and representation in money, banking and payments. The hope is that central banks view essential retailers as a trusted a entity for managing cbdc at the neighborhood level.
		</h3>

		<h3>My independent research seeks to help central banks outsource the complexity of managing their central bank digital currencies (cbcd) to regulated permissioned entities, such as essential retailers.  During times of stress (i.e. no power, no wifi) I envision measures similar to physical cash for offline payments for mobile devices.<h3>
