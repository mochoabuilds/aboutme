		<h2>A Program for Two Window Banking</h2>

		<h3>Throughout economic history no problem has been more passionately discussed than money.  Yet, as scholars have shown, credit and money generation does not operate as many people think it does.  This debate is not just of academic interest, it's a debate on its origins, which drives a discussion on who should control money's issuance. We understand this problem is not simple.  Historical accidents, powerful political forces and network effects have ensured only a select few can issue money and credit.  This head start has allowed wealthy banks to enjoy both tremendous success and spectacular failure over the centuries. We believe some of these highs and lows could be tempered by separating the provision of  payments from the provision of credit and money's issuance.  Under this backdrop, we describe a blueprint for “two window banking” that drives long overdue changes in banking law.  The goal is to take a tested idea and show how it could be transferred to new markets with regulatory frameworks embedded in.  Our blueprint may feel radical, but it is so because we envision a world in which large banks no longer play such a dominant role in everyday money and payments.
		</h3>
		
		<h3>This paper hashes out the system architecture, flowcharts of general processes and regulatory sandbox for a “two window bank”.  It details our challenges, why we built it the way we did and what we learned on the way. We assume the reader has basic knowledge of:  narrow banking, stablecoins, bank runs, the moral hazards of deposit insurance, monetary policy, fractional reserve banking, commercial law and software design. However we include an appendix to seed that foundational knowledge.  Within this paper we detail why our “two window bank” separates the functions of a bank into those of utility (i.e.  holding customers ACH to stablecoin deposits, for use at frequent interaction retailers, in an immediately redeemable reserve 100% equal to their deposits) and risk window (e.g.  lending activities with other assets and equity capital).  By focusing on a limited customer base (those without a bank accounts, mobile money in areas little to no server access) and incorporating non-traditional elements (reinvesting cost savings into a community asset trust to cultivate social capital) we aim to show how “two window banking” strengthens the liquidity of systemically important financial utilities.  The hope is to show how our proof of concept better connects the information, people and technology needed to process payments and issue money in normal periods and times of stress. 
		</h3>

		<h3>A new body of scholarship is blossoming to explore the predicates and possibilities of alternative approaches to banking, such as “two window banking”.  This paper discusses how tenets of “law and political economy” can be used to mobilize against the intensifying inequality, racial injustice and ecological destruction brought on by conventional banking.  A key argument of our scholarship is that the economy is not a machine that follows its own rules but instead embedded in society and structured by law.  That is why, using law and political economy, we cook up a regulatory sandbox for our “two window bank” to drive long overdue changes in banking law.  Our applied research focused on:  how to motivate banking practices more aligned with society's preferences for financial stability, the technology features critical to integrating with central banks and how our platform ensures money remains “present everywhere, but important nowhere” to not interfere with monetary policy.   We believe the future of money, banking and payment belongs to whomever can make this hat trick happen.

<p> Engaged psychology and art history to build a business model around my undergraduate research. Designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
