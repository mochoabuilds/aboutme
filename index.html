		<h2>DIGITAL WALLETS: A CROSS-COUNTRY COUNTRY ANALYSIS
		</h2>

		<br>

		<h3>With social and legal order as it today, in which lawmakers have moved to general standards rather than specific rules, the published decisions of courts and governments agencies applying legislation are essential to sourcing specific rules of law.  These published decisions define the circumstances of cases and create the specific rules of legal obligation applicable in similar circumstances.
		</h3> 

		<h3>Though what is unique about these published decisions is that they are not explicit rules; instead they are merely the court's holding, that is, the minimum rule needed to explain the outcome of the case.  When stitched together these narrow court decisions –  a string of holdings – form broader decisional rules.  This respect for the fabric of prior published decisions with similar fact patterns is what the legal community calls a “precedent”. In simple terms, it's something done in the past that is called upon as reason for doing the same thing again to crystallize a rule. 
		</h3>

		<h3>The analysis of precedents used to create rules of legal obligation around digital wallets has, to our knowledge, received little cross country analysis.  This paper presents and tests an empirical approach to understanding legal precedent inspired by the flows of water.  We treat the legal precedents derived from the decisions of courts as a flow of information whose tap does sometimes run dry as new conditions arise not foreseen by the framers of existing precedents.  We believe the writing and research of lawyers, judges, law clerks and scholars ensure these precedents remain flowing to best give content to the law.  
		</h3>

		<h3>The flows of information we use for analysis are case citations appearing in judicial opinions.  The idea of analyzing judicial citation across countries may strike others as an overwhelming endeavor, poorly suited for statistical aggregation.  However, we believe the extensive research and writing that lawyers, judges and law clerks devote to unearthing and understanding precedents shows the weight it bring to the decisions of similar circumstances.
		</h3>


		<h3>The paper is organized as follows. Part II describes a theory on the incompleteness of law. Part III describes ex ante versus ex post creations of the law and distinguishes between rules and standards.  Part IV summarizes major developments around the incompleteness of law and the evolution of digital wallets regulation.  Part V describes court case samples and tables summarizing principal characteristics of citations around digital wallets.  Within this section we also develop a framework for using case citations to study the effects of details in law.  We then draw conclusions from this cross country analysis of court case citations.  The final part of this paper, Part VI, test our theories with an actionable digital wallet to suggest areas for future research.

<p> We designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story. I engaged psychology and art history to build a business model and marketing plan around my undergraduate research.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
