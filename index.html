		<h2>COVID-19 AS A FORCE IN CAPITAL MARKETS DEVELOPMENT: A SURVEY OF ## COUNTRIES
		</h2>

		<p>Imagine you are an investor in France.  You are entitled to a very different bundle of legal rights than someone in Britain or Taiwan.  Law differs greatly around the world.  It's why some countries develop much bigger capital markets than others.  And it's what made it so easy for some investors, empowered by technology, to buy and sell stocks from their living rooms during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

		<p>So why did capital markets develop more in some countries than others?  It's said a country's legal origin accounts for its relative friendliness of laws to investors.  Countries whose legal rules originate in common law traditions tend to protect investors considerably better than countries whose laws originate in French civil law tradition, with German and Scandinavian civil law countries located in the middle.  This trend confirms our basic claim that being an investor in France entitled you to a very different bundles of rights than someone in the Britain or Taiwan.
		</p>

		<p>Surprisingly, it turns out that few scholars have considered how legal origins affected the development of capital markets during the pandemic's trading frenzy.  To establish this link we created an index of formalism – a comparative statistical analysis that measures how legal origins, the quality of their investor protections and law enforcement differ among countries - and whether formalism shaped the quality of capital markets development.  The idea is to assess the ability of investors in different legal environments to enjoy strong legal protections for their investments.  Because a good legal environment protects investors against unscrupulous practices, raises their willingness to invest funds and hence the development of capital markets.
		</p>

		<p>To assess these differences in legal environments we look at legal procedures and laws pertaining to investor protections.  We examine four types:  property rights, private contracts, company laws and bankruptcy/reorganization law.  Within this paper we show how all four serve as a proxy to measure the ease with which shareholders and creditors can exert investors protections within capital markets.  To evaluate how these differences affect the development of capital markets we created a questionnaire.  We then provide it to Lex Mundi member law firms with offices across ## countries.  
		</p>

		<p>The fact that most countries inherit significant parts of their legal procedures – often involuntarily – is important for our analysis.  At the econometric level, it suggests that legal origin can be used as an instrument for measuring the degree of formalism – that is, the quality of investor protections and law enforcement – among countries.  This enables us to establish two hypotheses.  If countries select their legal procedures voluntarily, then one can argue that greater formalism led to greater capital market development during the pandemic.  However, if legal procedures come thru colonization or conquest, the efficient adoption model does not apply.  
		</p>

		<p>The goal of this paper is to assemble a data set covering legal procedures pertaining to investor protections and the quality of their enforcement, in ## countries that have publicly traded companies during 2020-2022.  By establishing whether legal procedures and enforcement pertaining to investor protection differ across countries we can ask, whether, in a statistical sense, legal origin matters and whether these differences had large effects on the size, breadth and valuation of capital markets development during the pandemic.

<h2>Nooz</h2>
<p>I led a group of computer engineering, architecture and graphic design students on a machine learning project. Our project was supported by grants from two universities. We designed mobile software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure 
index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more 
personal quality to a breaking news story. Seed Funding Perkins Coie LLP </p>
