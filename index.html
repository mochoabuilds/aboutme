		<h2>THE EVOLUTION OF DIGITAL WALLETS: HOW THE INCOMPLETESS OF LAW INFLUENCES ITS DEVELOPMENT</h2>

		<br>

		<h3>When I was a teenager I worked a cash register.  At the end of the day the register told us how much money was supposed to have been collected during our shift.  If we made a mistake and the “take” was less than what the register said the deficit was said to have come out of our paycheck.  This experience forever colored my reaction to the rules and standards around money.  It also left me with some stomach churning questions such as:  1) how do law makers and law enforcement institutions (i.e.  police, inspectors, tax auditors, prosecutors) work together to deliver different rules, standards and legal regimes around money?  2) what tools could be used to interpret the large quantities of data available concerning the activities of courts and judges on the topic of money?
		</h3> 

		<h3>As long as legal scholars and lawmakers have to worry about the consequences that a new law brings, they'll continue to call upon the tools of law and economics.  Its study concerns itself with how changes in the law change the way people behave.  Major pockets of laws and rules are ripe for more informed attention from law and economics.  This paper calls upon these tools to ask bold questions that have not been asked regarding readily obtainable data concerning the activities of courts and judges around digital wallets.  We argue that law is inherently incomplete and that the incompleteness of law has important implications for the design of lawmaking and law enforcement institutions.  When law is incomplete, existing law extended to new cases, must be allocated.  In this paper we analyze the “optimal” allocation of lawmaking and law enforcement rights under incomplete law, focusing on the legislature, regulator and courts as holders of these lawmaking rights.  Using the tools of law and economics we show that the “optimal” allocation of lawmaking and law enforcement rights is determined by the degree and nature of incompleteness of law and the magnitude of the expected damage of harmful actions.  In the second part of the paper  we apply to the analytical framework to the development of digital wallets tied to community asset trusts regulation, with some comparative references to developments in developing economies.

<p> We designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story. I engaged psychology and art history to build a business model and marketing plan around my undergraduate research.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
