		<h2>A Program for Two Window Banking</h2>

		<h3>Throughout economic history no problem has been more passionately discussed than money. Its discussion is not of just academic interest, it's a debate on its origins, which it turn drives discussion on who should control the issuance of money. We understand this problem is not simple.  Recorded history has shown the private issuance of money repeatedly leads to major societal problems, due to misfires in lending.  We believe this problem could be stabilized by separating the provision of payments, from the provision of finance.  This paper outlines the promise of “two window banking” by taking a tested idea and transferring it to a new market with regulatory frameworks embedded in.  Ultimately our goal is show how our platform more meaningfully meets regulation paradigms in the context of a global world.  
		</h3>
		
		<h3>This paper hashes out a regulatory framework and technical architecture for “two window banking” in normal times and periods of stress.  It details our challenges, why we built it the way we did and what we learned on the way. We assume the reader has a basic knowledge of banks runs, fractional reserve banking, deposit insurance, narrow banking, regulatory sandboxes, commercial law and software design. However, we include an appendix to help build that foundational knowledge.  Following this introduction, we detail how our “two window bank” separates the functions of a bank into those of utility window (i.e.  ACH to stablecoin transfers AKA direct debit, for use at frequent interaction retailers; requires banks to hold reserves 100% equal to demand deposit to be default free) and risk window (i.e. lending activities with other assets and equity capital). Our proof of concept connects the information, people and technology needed to sustainably issue money on a single platform designed for efficiency, scale and offline payments.  By targeting a limited customer base (those without a bank account or mobile money) and incorporating non-traditional elements (reinvesting cost savings into a community asset trust to cultivate social capital) we hope to show how our proof of concept window banking” strengthens the liquidity of systemically important financial utilities.  To illuminate the potential of “two window banking” we share: experiments with learning the technology, economic models, test features critical to integrating with central banks and how we translate the many “verbs” of payments. 
		</h3>

		<h3>Using law and economics we aim to cook up a regulatory framework for “two window banking”. Our research considers how to better enforce central banks terms closer to the ground, while staying in step with laws and market preferences.  We believe the future of money, banking and payments belongs to whomever can make this hat trick happen.

<p> Engaged psychology and art history to build a business model around my undergraduate research. Designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
