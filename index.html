		<h2>XYZ-TBD'S PRECEDENTS AND LEGAL FACTORS: A THEORETICAL AND EMPRICIAL ANALYSIS</h2>

		<p>20th century laws don't always solve 21st century problems.  To solve the toughest challenges of our information age we must address the incompleteness of law and create new precedents.  But what exactly is a precedent?  In simple terms, it's a past work of law that is called upon as reason for doing the same thing again.  Although a precedent does not “wear out” in a physical sense, it depreciates because the value of its information declines over time with changing social and economic conditions.  To illustrate, a decision involving a crash between two horse drawn wagons is bound to lose some of its precedent value as wagons are replaced by driver less vehicles.  For that reason we explore the incompleteness of law around xyz-tbd and the need for greater specificity to keep pace with 21st century problems.</p>

		<p>The use of precedents (and other factors) to create rules of legal obligation has, to our knowledge, received little theoretical or empirical analysis.  That in mind, we test an economic approach to understanding the legal factors that may influence a judge's decision on rules.  The primary data for this analysis are precedents and case citations appearing in judicial opinions.  Secondary data include:  judge ideology, persuasiveness of lower court opinion and the influence of law clerks.  While none play a direct role in the results of a case, they all influence a judge's decision.  Our model also explores the relationship between primary / secondary data and the changing demographic population of a court systems geographic population.  The goal is explore at what population trends do different levels of court begin to grow inflexible regarding how frequently they reference precedents and citations outside their ideology?  Because of the uniqueness of our approach to analysis, we develop our model in more detail in sections that follow.</p>

		<p>The nature of this 21st century problem - the factors that influence a judge's decision and the incompleteness of law - causes society to underestimate how quickly 20th century laws create headaches for 21st century problems.  If we don't devise better ways of understanding the factors driving these decisions then it'll tremendously difficult for future xyz-tbd legislation to have any teeth.  While the idea of an analyzing precedents, judicial citation practices and other legal factors may strike others as an overwhelming endeavor, we don't believe so.  We find the extensive research and writing that lawyers, law clerks and judges devote to discovering and explaining precedents are not lost causes, and would not be undertaken if precedent did not enter consistently into the decision of cases.  Law is not the work of judge alone but of judge and company.</p>

		<p>This paper is organized as follows.  Part II describes a theory on the incompleteness of law.  Part III summarizes major developments around the analysis of precedents and other legal factors influencing a judge's decision. Part IV describes our case samples and presents tables summarizing the principles characteristics of basic and secondary data.  Part V formalizes our model and derives hypotheses.  Part VI empirically analyzes the court case samples and other legal factors to study precedent flows.  The final part of this paper, Part VII, suggests some areas for future research using the approach developed here.</p>

<h2>Nooz</h2>
<p> We designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story. I engaged psychology and art history to build a business model and marketing plan around my undergraduate research.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
