		<h2>THE EFFECTS OF LEGAL ORIGIN ON CAPITAL MARKETS DEVELOPMENT DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC: A SURVEY OF ## COUNTRIES 
		</h2>

		<p>Why did some countries grow much bigger capital markets than others during the COVID-19 pandemic?  Why did hundreds of companies go public in the United States during the pandemic, while only a few went public in other nations?  And why did commission-free trading apps, such as Robinhood, make considerable headway during lock-downs in some countries and not others?
		</p>

		<p>Surprisingly, it turns out that few scholars have considered how the effects of legal origins, and its influence on rules and their enforcement, on capital markets development during the pandemic.  Our paper aims to empirically establish the link between legal origins, inherited legal procedures and capital markets. 
		</p>

		<p>To accomplish this we investigate cross country differences in legal procedure pertaining to property rights and private contracts.  We present an analysis of how a plaintiff uses the court to evict a non-paying tenant and collect a bounced check.  Our paper details the legal procedures triggered to resolve these disputes in ## countries before, during and after the pandemic.  We use this collected data to build an index of formalism – a measure of how legal procedure differs across countries – and ask whether formalism varies across countries and shaped the quality of capital markets growth during the pandemic.    
		</p>

		<p>Focusing on these two disputes has its advantages.  First, both represent an everyday occurrence that is comparable in all the countries analyzed.  Second, these disputes involve lower level courts, an arena relevant to many of a country's inhabitants.  Lastly, property rights and private contracts are both crucial to well functioning capital markets.</p>

		<p>To gather the relevant data for index of formalism we developed a questionnaire that we provide to Lex Mundi member law firms with offices across the world.  The goal was to gather responding firm's descriptions of the step-by-step procedures involved with eviction and check collection before, during and after the pandemic.  In addition, we fold in assessments of judicial quality and market quality measures.  All together the evidence supports our hypothesis that legal origin's influence on property rights and private contracts may be inefficient, and in turn it affected capital markets development during the pandemic.</p>

<h2>Nooz</h2>
<p>I led a group of computer engineering, architecture and graphic design students on a machine learning project. Our project was supported by grants from two universities. We designed mobile software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure 
index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more 
personal quality to a breaking news story. Seed Funding Perkins Coie LLP </p>
