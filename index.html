		<h2>HOW THOUGHTS OF MORTALITY STEMMING FROM COVID-19 MEDIA COVERAGE INFLUENCED JUDICIAL OPINION (AND HOW “PERSONALIZED RULE” COULD ADVANCE THE LAW) 
		</h2>

		<p>Imagine you are a judge.  How do you reach decisions?  It's easy when there is a law, statute or precedent on point;  you follow it.  But what happens when the law is unclear or in flux?  Your judicial restraint – solidified by years of legal training and the rule of law – imposes strong limits on your decisions and ensures personal choice doesn't dominate considerations of law, statute or precedent.  This is what makes the law work as it should.
		</p>

		<p>Our essay investigates what influenced judges to reach the decisions they during COVID-19.  We argue thoughts of mortality stemming from media coverage of the pandemic increased the rate at which judges wrote opinions that crossed partisan lines, relative to their pre-pandemic selves.  To explore this theoretical argument we combed information embedded in ### judicial opinions from YYYY to YYYY and data on the newspaper coverage of ### state district court judges from YYYY to YYYY.
		</p>

		<p>To put this argument in perspective let's consider the game of baseball.  Within this past time different umpires define the “strike-zone” differently, so players adjust their tactics to a particular umpire, much like how judges interpret cases, statues and precedents differently.  We argue, as a way of counteracting  thoughts of mortality stemming from media coverage of the pandemic judges moved their judicial “strike-zone” to affirm the fundamental rules governing a stable society, even if it meant crossing partisan lines. 
		</p>

		<p>	Surprisingly,	few scholars have considered how thoughts of mortality spread to influence judicial opinion during the pandemic.    Our natural language processing (NLP) research shows how these this media coverage increased the rate at which judges wrote opinions that crossed partisan lines and moved the “strike-zone” relative to their pre-pandemic selves.  Based on these findings and existing legal doctrine we conclude that courts enact “personalized rule”, set on a topical basis, to continue affirming the fundamental rules of the law with a more surgical precision.</p>

<h2>Nooz</h2>
<p> We designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story. I engaged psychology and art history to build a business model and marketing plan around my undergraduate research.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
