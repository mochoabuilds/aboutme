		<h2>THE INCOMPLETENESS OF LAW AROUND XYZ-TBD: A CROSS-COUNTRY ANALYSIS

		</h2>

		<p>It is always frustrating when you realize law does not always keep up with technology.  No one likes the idea of meeting with victims and saying 'we can't help you'.  Until we devise better ways of understanding xyz-tbd it'll be tremendously difficult for any legislation to have any teeth. 
		</p>

		<p>Currently legal precedent involving xyz-tbd is slim.  With limited precedent, lawmakers around the world are sleuthing for test cases to mimic or reject.  This makes for a fascinating global politics, because countries are competing with each other on who's going to set the tone.  To our knowledge, the analysis of precedents used to create rules of legal obligation around xyz-tbd has received little cross country analysis.
		</p>

		<p>	To boost our understanding of precedents this paper treats  legal precedents as a “flow of water” subject to the usual economic theories governing the formation and depreciation of capital.  We use this approach to generate hypotheses concerning the flow of new precedents, the total volume of precedents, the rate precedents “dry up” and the interaction among these variables.  Our focus is on measuring these flows and interactions, and combining them with data on citations to estimate and test hypotheses.  The goal is to compare the “drying up” of judicial decisions with those of administrative agency decisions, statues and constitutional provisions, to compare different courts, examine citation practices in briefs and examine the “drying out” question from a historical and citation standpoint.  We are especially interested in exploring whether adherence to precedent has declined over time, particularly in certain courts around the topic of xyz-tbd.  Exploring this trend of “drying out” may bring more light to this question, as may our cross-country analysis of different courts.
		</p>

		<p>The idea of a cross country analysis of judicial citations across countries may strike others as an overwhelming endeavor, poorly suited for statistical aggregation.  Though we believe the extensive research and writing that judges, attorneys, law clerks, court clerks, jurors, witnesses and litigants have devoted to understanding precedents shows the weight they bring to decisions of similar cases.  Our methods may be described as follows:  we translate data on precedents into citations to represent rules and standards, and then interweave those citations into a framework that tests our hypotheses.  This approach helps us better manage the tide of legal information and create a common language for a discussion of the open problems around the incompleteness of law around xyz-tbd.
		</p>

		<p>This paper is organized as follows. Part II describes a theory on the incompleteness of law. Part III describes ex ante versus ex post creations of the law and distinguishes between rules and standards.  Part IV summarizes major developments in the evolution of xyz-tbd regulation.  Part V describes our court case samples.  Within this section we also develop the framework for understanding how to use case citations to study the effects of details in xyz-tbd law.  We then formalize our model, derive hypotheses and discuss the production of precedents and apply it to the evolution of xyz-tbd legislation with longer shelf life, lower enforcement costs and higher factor reliability.  The final part of this paper, Part VI, put our theories into action with prototype software and suggests areas for future research using the framework developed here.</p>

<h2>Nooz</h2>
<p> We designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story. I engaged psychology and art history to build a business model and marketing plan around my undergraduate research.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
