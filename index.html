		<h2>GROWING CASELOAD, THE WAY JUDGES BEHAVE AND THE PROMISE OF 'PERSONALIZED RULE' </h2>

		<p>Imagine you are a judge.  It's easy when there is a precedent or statue on point; you follow it.  But what do you do when a new activity emerges and the rights and duties of the people engaged are unclear?  Good judges will make decisions on the topic not on the basis of personal choices but judicial philosophy, case facts and precedent.  Yet given the vastness of law and its extension into all sorts of controversial areas it's inevitable some decisions will fall back on personal choices.  This is what makes judging difficult.</p>

		<p>What should be done?  The best defense is for the courts, which encompass the judiciary, its staff and technological resources, to do their job well.  That is, articulate well-reasoned persuasive explanations for their decisions.  This protects the courts from serving up offensive jugment deprived of persuasion and reasoning, the kind of decisions that destroy our faith in judicial systems.  Such a defense is what makes the law work. </p>

		<p>This essay explores what causes the law not to work.  We show how our court system has not developed satisfactorily, and how procedural practices in the federal courts don't support the judges as squarely as we'd like.  Our empirical research shows that heavy caseload has unexpectedly led to the law not working as it should.  
		</p>

		<p>To put readers in the right mindset to absorb and agree with our claim we show how the federal court of appeals bears a heavy burden.  In recent years more than ##### applications for review have been filed in the court each year.  The pressure is staggering.  Pressure driving heavy caseload include: 1) increases in new activities and the rights and duties of the people engaged in them; 2)increases in the number and significance of ties among people from all over the world; 3) increases in social legislation and regulatory provisions.  These factors have combined to produce an explosion of litigation beyond anything seen in the past.  Add in the duties of hearing arguments, conferring with judges and more and this heavy workload problem causes the law to not work as it should.
		</p>

		<p>The consequence of this is a collection of judges who work very hard on an individual basis, but with little authoritative guidance from their own circuit or from higher courts.  The consequence of that is a system of precedent on which common law is based has lost much of its structure and influence.  In essence we now have an increasingly discretionary approach to justice.  With fewer binding precedents, and judges now look more to opinions of other judges in others courts, with an eye on creating a precedent rather than finding one.  Our theoretical argument is that heavy caseload, coupled with the way judges behave within the federal court of appeals, has unexpectedly led to the courts failing to recognize their duty of weighing considerations of social advantage.</p>

		<p>With the law looking unsound, we wonder what the answer is.  To illustrate our claim further let's consider some scenarios.  Advances in competition, taxation, privacy, financial services, consumer protection or anything new, have the same basic operational problem in dealing with change: change tends to happen more quickly than judicial decisions cycles, and in parallel, change creates a heavier caseload for the courts.  We believe these scenarios cause judicial efficiency to become a primary weight put in the balance when making decisions.  The heavier the caseload, the heavier this weight grows.  Striking this balance is what makes judging difficult.  
		</p>

		<p>This discretionary approach inevitably causes the court of appeals to be badly overworked and not work satisfactorily.  We believe this promotes a lack of discipline among court of appeals judges, said with great respect.  In our view, burdened by heavy caseload stemming from new activities, some judges would rather create a precedent than find one to shape the law of a case.  This discretionary approach causes the law to not work as it should.    
		</p>

		<p>What should be done?  Well, the law has never been precise or scientific, and often is unclear.  But in the past, much more was clear and could be relied upon to make decisions.  However due to advances in our society, that is no longer the case.  To fashion some sort of solution to this problem of the law not working as it should we propose that cases of statutory Constitution be decided by 'personalized rule'.  We define this 'rule' as precision law characterized by the primary features of individualization and machine-sorted information.  Examples of cases of statutory Constitution include questions of taxation and administrative law.  These cases do not involve constitutional questions; and are not important in regards to civil liberties, national security or federal-state relations, and these cases occur often. </p>

		<p>We understand the pain and time associated with heavy caseload.  We believe 'personalized rule' is uniquely suited to provide instant ruling on matters of tax and administrative law based on its core technology, which uses AI to provide a real-time ruling based on the user's characteristics at time of a ruling.  Courts simply integrate its framework into their technology, and it handles the rest.  'Personalized rule' solves this issue of heavy caseload in order to keep the judicial effort moving for the good of all.  Its value proposition also becomes clearer once you consider how the courts of appeals is handling more rulings with a discretionary approach to justice.  One that has unexpectedly led to the courts failing to recognize their duty of weighing considerations of social advantage. 
		</p>

		<p>Surprisingly, it turns out that few scholars have considered how heavy caseload, coupled with the way judges behave within the federal court of appeals, has unexpectedly led to the law not working as it should and why it should therefore be extended to include 'personalized rule'.  Some may disagree with our theory and solution, and this essay explores why they are wrong.  We confront the other sides arguments and criticisms, and describe why the benefits of 'personalized rule'  outweigh its costs.  We show how 'personalized rule' has the potential to outperform discretionary enforcement practices.  We also consider what will happen if our theory and solution is accepted.

<h2>Nooz</h2>
<p> We designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story. I engaged psychology and art history to build a business model and marketing plan around my undergraduate research.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
