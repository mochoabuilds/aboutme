		<h2>STOCK MARKETS IN THE TIME OF COVID-19</h2>

		<p>This paper examines securities markets growth using ## countries as a comparison case study.  We hypothesize that the development of decent investor protections and enforcement infrastructure preceded or at least accompanied securities markets growth during the pandemic.  Our empirical analysis explores whether the pandemic expedited the convergence between different securities governance systems. To measure this we comb accounting disclosures, legal procedure, commercial code and company law to produce an investor protections and enforcement index.  The index analyzes the difficultly a country faces moving from a bank centered capital market (companies go public based on reputation) to a securities-marketed centered capital market (in which companies trade on the reputations of others, local culture and investor protections).  Our index shows the minimum conditions needed for a country to achieve a strong securities market by measuring:  efficiency of the judiciary, rule of law, corruption, risk of expropriation, risk of contract repudiation, accounting standards and social capital.  Our index explores whether common law countries had a better match between investor protections and enforcement infrastructure than civil law countries during the pandemic, and whether the pandemic expedited the convergence between different securities governance systems as represented by their legal origin.

<h2>Nooz</h2>
<p>I led a group of computer engineering, architecture and graphic design students on a machine learning project. Our project was supported by grants from two universities. We designed mobile software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure 
index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more 
personal quality to a breaking news story. Seed Funding Perkins Coie LLP </p>
