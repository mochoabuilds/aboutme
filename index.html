		<h2>TRENDS IN JUDICIAL STATISTICS, TAX LIABILITY STATISTICS AND JUDICIAL BEHAVIOR & THE PROMISE OF 'SPECIALIZED COURTS'
		</h2>

		<p>This essay is a survey of the 13 federal courts, tracing the relationship between judicial statistics, tax liability statistics and judicial behavior, via federal tax cases.  The essay hypothesizes that heavy caseload-workload numbers have seeded a confusion where the aggressive tax strategies of private powerful actors thrive.  The complexity and speed of their creep make it a near impossible train for government to catch.  The challenge is clear.  Design a comprehensive theory of tax fit for this unique problem that better wrangles their aggressive tax strategies. Our empirical research explores how heavy caseload-workload has unexpectedly led to a harried discretionary approach to justice that causes judges to fail to recognize their duty of weighing considerations of social advantage around tax law, and should therefore be extended to include 'specialized courts'.  Our vision unites law, psychology, economics and ethics to assess current tax systems and prescribe changes that respond to longstanding complaints that some tax rules are under inclusive in areas as digital assets, FBAR violations, labor brokers.

<h2>Nooz</h2>
<p> We designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story. I engaged psychology and art history to build a business model and marketing plan around my undergraduate research.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
