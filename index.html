<p>Developer Statement</p>
I'm a Chicagoan, with wide ranging interests. Trained as a sociologist before turning to the development of software and hardware, I build technology with a more intuitive approach, distinguished from the highly systemic and science-based theories used by many CS/ECE graduates. Instead I study the cultural, institutional and scientific conditions that increase the efficiency, productivity and innovative capacity of code.  This approach better draws on lessons from history and applies them to real-world coding problems to harmonize or enhance day-to-day life.  My goal is to bring fantasy and invention to computer vision applications (and software development).<br/>
<br/>
I see the possibilities of computer vision's mass production and have developed my own small factory, equipped with the latest machines and methods to streamline processes. My computer vision applications are conceived as a piece of mini-architecture. The current piece forges a link between the sinuous curves of the late 19th century's Aesthetic movement and Japanese art and design.  The software, hardware and design processes have yet to reach a natural end, and a more interdisciplinary, explicit study of the processes itself are the next steps.
