		<h2>THE INCOMPLETENESS OF LAW AROUND DIGITAL WALLETS: A CROSS-COUNTRY COMPARISON</h2>

		<br>

		<h3>When I was a teenager I worked a cash register.  At the end of the day the register told us how much money was supposed to have been collected during our shift.  If we made a mistake and the “take” was less than what the register displayed the deficit was said to have come out of our paycheck.  The experience forever colored my reaction to rules and standards.  More importantly it left me with some stomach churning questions about money. 
		</h3> 

		<h3>In this paper, we focus on the political economy of the incompleteness of law around digital wallets between the 2010s and today.  Within Part I we establish the existence of this decline with a historical perspective on digital wallets and the incompletness of its law, and in the rest of the paper we rely on several new data sets to identify the forces that caused it.  We begin, in Part II, by establishing that the decline was not driven by the publics' preferences.  In this section we show the percipitating structural, cultural and psychological factors that amplified this decline.   In Part III, we comb through more complex forms of public accountability.  We begin by peeking at instruments used by elected officials – new laws and executive orders on digital wallets – and then  1) explore large quantities of statistical data readily avaliable concerning the activities of courts and judges;  2) address the evolution of contract and tort law in relation to misrepresentation of information;  3) examine how corporate law does not evolve in isolation, but in close interaction socioeconomic conditions and politics.  We also explore how elected officials almost never use their powers in a open way to restrict antitrust law around digital wallets – either by passing laws or voting to confirm judges.    
		</h3>

		<h3>In Part IV, we show that nearly all essential decisions that reshaped digital wallets policy were made by regulators and judges with little democratic accountability.  If the decline of antitrust law around digital wallets was due to independent decisions of regulators and judges rather than elected officials, the stomach churning questions arises, who drove that decision making?  Its said the answer is no one:  officials merely enacted the best policy they could, based on the best thinking of the time, shielded from the emotions of voters.  Within Part V, we argue that this view of no one is too dismissive.  There is no evidence that the relaxation of antitrust enforcement around digital wallets benefited the economy, while there is plenty of evidence big credit card networks benefited from it at the expense of merchants and consumers.  This outcome brings confusion about the merits of experts when exercised by people with no accountability to those most affected by the policy outcomes.  This evidence as well as our theory suggest that big credit card networks have pushed forward an antitrust agenda.  To add meat to this hypothesis we examine a range of historical factors from the early days of electronic payments that explain how big card networks obtained advantages in the public arena of lawmaking.  To test this hypothesis we devise a database to “test” competing propositions for digital wallets regulation by examining the status quo and where providers fall short.  Our database is drawn from a detailed mapping of the evolution of corporate law in ten jurisdictions.  We identify, categorize, summarize and source legal requirements from coproate law and digital wallet legislation across France, Germany, England and the United States.  We also include nations that have received their corporate laws either directly or indirectly from these four jurisdictions. Using six key legal indicators we identify patterns of legal change and capture the evolution of law around digital wallets.  We are keenly aware that with this approach there remains a possibility that variables other than those we identify may explain the differences in outcome.  We also understand explaining the evolution of corporate structural, cultural and psychological norms seems to be just as important as identifying these six key indicators.  Either way, by comparing multiple systems we can understand better what makes each written rule and their enforcement work.  In part VI we use tools of law and economics to explore the rights under which allocating residual lawmaking rights to legislatures, courts and regulators would be “optimal”.   
		</h3>

		<h3>To ensure our theory on how the incompleteness of law impacts digital wallets regulation  maintains its gusto we test it with additional sources of real world data within part VII.   We believe vibrant legal discourse requires a continual dialogue between theory and evidence.  To drum up this dialgoue we created our own digital wallet tied to a community asset trust.  Our payment processing system seamlessly integrates a digital wallet into an automated clearing house (ACH) network to spare United States based merchants some of the approxmately 3% fee commonly charged by card networks for payment processing.  It also helps merchants enhance their customer experience, create operational efficiencies and drive growth.  We funnel a portion of these cost savings for merchants into a community asset trust tied to compassionate social programs.  The goal is to analyze the challenges posed by this evolving market and discuss a regulatory framework for digital wallet's evolving forms.   We believe with a continual dialogue between theory and real world data we can better test our theories and suggest new ones that can then be extended or rejected.  The hope is that this paper can add to the debates on inequality, democracy and governance around the evolving rules, standards around money.

<p> We designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story. I engaged psychology and art history to build a business model and marketing plan around my undergraduate research.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
