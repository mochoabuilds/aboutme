		<h2>TRENDS IN THE CASELOAD AND WORKLOAD OF THE FEDERAL COURTS: THE PROMISE OF 'PERSONALIZED RULE' </h2>

		<p>Imagine being a judge.  It's easy when there is a statue or precedent on point; you follow it.  But what do you do when a new activity arises, and the rights and duties of the people engaged are unclear?  Good judges will make decisions not on the basis of personal value choices but technical legal judgments.  But with the vastness of law and its extension into all sorts of controversial areas it's inevitable some decisions will fall back on personal value choices.  This is what makes judging difficult.  The best defense is for the courts, which encompass the judiciary, its staff and technological resources, to do their job well.  That is, articulate well-reasoned persuasive explanations for their judicial decisions.  This is what makes the law work.  Such defense protects the courts from serving up offensive judgment deprived of persuasion and reasoning, the kind of personal decisions that destroy our faith in judicial systems.</p>

		<p>This paper explores what should be done in situations where law doesn't work.  We consider how the federal judiciary can prepare itself (or be prepared) to meet this problem of when a new activity arises, and the rights and duties of the people engaged are unclear.  To begin we must understand what happens when a new activity arises.  At first, when a new activity arises (e.g. transportation by autonomous taxi), the rights and duties of people engaged in it are likely to be uncertain.  Those rights and duties will therefore be constructed by analogy to the rights and duties of people engaged in similar activities (e.g. transportation by taxi), but analogy is an inexact method for generating legal rules.  The resulting uncertainty will generate litigation, in which the rights and duties of those involved in the new activity will be hashed out, reducing legal uncertainty and litigation in the next cycle.  But if the activity is changing (e.g. transportation by autonomous air taxi), the lull in litigation will create new legal uncertainty because the old precedents will not be perfectly adapted to the new legal changes, and so in the next period there will be more litigation again.  The hope is that this surge in litigation creates enough precedents to reduce the amount of legal certainty and caseload, in the next.  We should not be surprised to encounter these litigation cycles.</p>

		<p>	This research explores whether or not there's a pattern of litigation within a particular area of law that may be cyclical.  To explore this theory our empirical analysis treats judicial decisions around law that is unclear or in flux as a product, the quantity of which is governed by the economic laws of supply and demand.  This allows us to emphasize the role of litigants' choice in caseloads and workloads.  The focus is on finding data that supports our claim that sometimes the courts fail to recognize their duty of weighing considerations of social advantage when burdened by heavy litigation cycles.  </p>

		<p>	My empirical research shows that heavy litigation cycles, coupled with the techniques of the federal court of appeals, has unexpectedly led to fractured decision making and should therefore be extended to include 'personalized rule' to alleviate this behavior.   My goal is to describe, as best I can, how 'personalized rule' – that is: person specific rule characterized by individualization and machine sorted information – creates additional capacity within the federal courts. 
		</p>

		<p>	When new rights are first created their scope is often unclear.  Litigation rates are high at the onset of a period of legal change, and appeal rates also high because at the court of appeals level precedents, which define legal right and duties, are created.  These decisions matter.  As things stand, federal judges must ask whether the unclear law in question is “analogous” to another with relevant similarities.  It requires judges to perform legal reasoning that pulls their decision into the best constructive light that highlights the best principle that accounts for their decision.  This process ensures that the law is what matters, not personal value choices.  My goal is to describe, as best I can, ways to create additional capacity within the courts, and find data that supports our claim that sometimes the courts fail to recognize their duty of weighing considerations of social advantage when burdened by heavy litigation cycles.

<h2>Nooz</h2>
<p> We designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story. I engaged psychology and art history to build a business model and marketing plan around my undergraduate research.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
