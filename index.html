		<h2>DIGITAL WALLETS PRECEDENTS: A CROSS-COUNTRY COUNTRY ANALYSIS
		</h2>

		<br>

		<h3>With social and legal order as it today, in which lawmakers have moved to general standards rather than specific rules, the published decisions of courts and governments agencies applying legislation are important to sourcing specific rules of law.  These published decisions define the circumstances of cases and create the specific rules of legal obligation applicable in similar circumstances.
		</h3> 

		<h3>Though what is unique about these published decisions is that they are not explicit rules; instead they are merely the court's holding, that is, the minimum rule needed to explain the outcome of the case.  Though when strung together these  narrow in scope court decisions –  a string of holdings – come together to form broader decisional rules.  This respect for prior published decisions in court cases with similar fact patterns is what the legal community would call a “precedent”. In simple terms, it's something done in the past that is called upon as reason for doing the same thing again to crystallize a rule.  It is much the same as law.  
		</h3>

		<h3>The analysis of precedents used to create rules of legal obligation around digital wallets has, to our knowledge, received little cross country analysis.  This paper presents and tests an empirical approach to legal precedent derived from the analysis of flows of water.  We treat the legal precedents derived from the decisions of courts as a flow of information whose tap does sometimes run dry as new conditions arise not foreseen by the framers of existing precedents.  We believe the writing and research of lawyers, judges, law clerks and scholars ensure these precedents remain flowing to best give content to the law.  
		</h3>

		<h3>The basic data for the analysis are case citation appearing in judicial opinions.  The idea of analyzing judicial citation across countries may strike others as an overwhelming endeavor, poorly suited for statistical aggregation.  However we believe the extensive research and writing that lawyers, judges and law clerks devote to unearthing and understanding precedents shows the shadow they cast onto the decision of cases. 
		</h3>

		<h3>The paper is organized as follows. Part I provides an historical perspective on digital wallets, and rules versus standards and the incompleteness of law. Part II describes our court case samples and presents tables summarizing the principal characteristics of citations.  Part III presents our theoretical analysis model. It is there we formalize our flows of water model, derive hypotheses and discuss the production of precedents in absence of a digital wallet market.  Part IV develops a framework for using case citations to study digital wallet precedents empirically and presents the results of our cross country analysis.  The final part of this paper, Part V, examines the desirability of ex ante versus ex post law creation in terms of legal costs, comments on the analysis and suggest some areas for future research using the approach developed here (as well as design report for an actionable digital wallet to test our theories).

<p> We designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story. I engaged psychology and art history to build a business model and marketing plan around my undergraduate research.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
