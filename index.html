		<h2> Two Window Banking & Regulatory Sandboxes</h2>

		<h3>700 words on the idea</h3>

		<h3>Throughout economic history no problem has been more passionately discussed than money. Why does this matter?  Historical accidents, powerful political forces and network effects have ensured only a few established banks can generate money and credit.  This model downplays considerations of distribution and makes the banks “efficiency” be seen as neutral.  The shortcoming of this is that it reproduces a legislative priority for established banks that accentuates inequality.   What are regulators doing about it?  New bodies of scholarship are emerging to challenge this idea of only a few banks being able to issue money.  Law and political economy is increasingly exploring a wider variety of legal fields to push back against intensifying  inequality.  The goal of these new models is to give regulators an umbrella framework under to deploy reflexive and iterative strategies that more flexibly deal with new problems as they arise.     Under this backdrop, this paper describes a blueprint for “two window banking” that separates the provision of  payments from the provision of finance.  Our blueprint may feel radical, but it is so because we envision a world in which “two window banks” mobilize against intensifying inequality, racial and gendered injustice and ecological destruction.
		</h3>
		
		<h3>What readers can expect from this paper?  This paper hashes out flowcharts of general processes, the system architecture and regulatory principles for a “two window bank”.  It details our challenges, why we built it the way we did and what we learned on the way. We assume the reader has basic knowledge of:  narrow banking, the moral hazards of deposit insurance, fractional reserve banking, stablecoins, monetary policy, regulatory sandboxes, commercial law and software design. However, we include an appendix to seed that foundational knowledge.  In this paper we detail why our “two window bank” separates the functions of a bank into those of utility (i.e.  holding customers ACH to stablecoin deposits, for use at frequent interaction retailers, in an instantly redeemable reserve 100% equal to their deposits) and risk window (i.e.   lending activities with other assets and equity capital).  A key tenet of this platform is that it not interfere with monetary policy.  To do this we set it up to be “present everywhere, but important nowhere” and focus on a limited customer base(e.g.  communities where money circulates at higher rates than average, areas with little to no data center space).  To extend and rebuild countervailing power in other contexts we also incorporate non-traditional elements (e.g.  reinvesting cost savings into a community asset trust for projects that actual benefit people in the community).   Our goal is to show how “two window banking” better connects the information, people and technology needed to process payments, issue money and provide credit in both normal periods and times of stress.  We believe the future of money, banking and payment belongs to whomever can jigsaw together the integration needed to unify the regulatory stack and connect it to an aesthetically pleasing brand.
		</h3>

		<h3>The combination of time and the capitalistic engine have created new markets in money, banking and payments.  Tho we cannot say that all this innovation is 'good' just because there is a market for it. What is the role of regulation in making banking more equitable?  What is the underlying theory of democratizing banking?  Regulation of new markets must remain an iterative process between private parties and regulators.  We believe the regulatory process could borrow from scholarship in “law and political economy” to design broad aspirational outcome-focused principles to benefit the broadest group of people.  To test these regulatory principles we propose the creation of a “regulatory sandbox”.  Within this sandbox private parties and regulators could glean valuable understanding of new technologies, test ideas and make adjustments on a small scale.  This iterative process makes it easier for regulation to accompany the prescriptive and detailed rule making mechanisms needed to make lawmaking move. Principles that could guide entry into a regulatory sandbox include a focus on:  consumer protection, financial stability and collective trust.  We believe a regulatory sandbox for testing  our “two window banking” platform could allow us to keep the capitalistic engine in motion. More importantly, this sandbox offers us hope we can build tools that reflect society's values, train the next generation of financial regulators and mobilize against the intensifying inequality, racial and gendered injustice and ecological destruction brought on by conventional banking.

<p> Engaged psychology and art history to build a business model around my undergraduate research. Designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
