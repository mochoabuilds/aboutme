		<h2>A Program for Two Window Banking</h2>

		<h3>Throughout economic history no problem has been more vigorously discussed than money. Any discussion of its origins is not just of academic interest, it's a debate on its politics, which in turn drives the discussion on who should control its issuance. We understand this problem is not simple. We believe the money problem could be stabilized by separating the provision of payments, from the provision of finance.  Acting as a bridge between traditional banking and financial technology, this paper outlines the emerging regulatory framework and technical architecture for a “two window bank”.  The broader purpose is to show how our platform helps de novo banks like ours meaningfully meet regulation paradigms in the context of a global world.  Ultimately our goal is make mobile money “present everywhere, but important no where” to better fit the monetary policy goals of regulators.
		</h3>
		
		<h3>This paper details our successes and challenges and why we built it the way we did and what we learned on the way. We assume the reader has a basic knowledge of banks runs, fractional reserve banking, deposit insurance, narrow banking, regulatory sandboxes, commercial law and software design. However, we include an appendix to help build that foundational knowledge. Following this introduction, we detail how our “two window bank” separates the functions of a bank into those of utility window (i.e.  direct debit, defined as ACH to stablecoin transfers, for use at frequent interaction retailers; requires banks to hold reserves 100% equal to demand deposit to be default free) and risk window (i.e. lending activities with other assets and equity capital).  Our proof of concept embeds both functional windows into a mobile interface along with supervisory and regulatory requirements to trim compliance costs and cut out value extracting middlemen. Cost savings derived from this approach are then channeled into a community asset trust to cultivate social capital. By targeting a limited customer base and incorporating non-traditional elements we hope to show how “two window banking” strengthens the liquidity of systemically important financial utilities., especially in emerging economies. To illuminate the potential of our proof of concept we share:  experiments with learning the technology, test features critical to central bank services and validation of its inexpensive operations. 
		</h3>

		<h3>Using the realism and analytics of law and economics we aim to cook up a regulatory framework for “two window banking”.  Until then, one thing is clear.  Scholars have largely neglected the intersection of finance, regulation and technology that is transforming the financial system, and society more broadly. The most valuable research must consider how to better enforce central banks terms closer to the ground, while staying in step with laws all the while responding to market preferences.  The future of money, banking and payments belongs to whomever can make this hat trick happen.

<p> Engaged psychology and art history to build a business model around my undergraduate research. Designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
