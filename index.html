		<h2>Redirecting Money, Banking and Payments Towards Middle Class Stability
</h2>

		<br>

		<h3>In recent years, the cost to merchants of accepting credit cards has spiked without a corresponding increase in the benefits.  This has left merchants dissatisfied with the structure of payment systems.   We believe in widening the payments palate for merchants.  This project offers payment services as a commodity so merchants and consumers can receive a better package of services at lower costs.  We see transactions being processed on a merchant owned debit card network that piggybacks on interchange-free ACH technology.   The idea is to steer consumers towards funding their digital wallet with cost saving financial intermediaries (ACH transactions), and funneling a portion of this cost savings for merchants into a community asset trust for compassionate social programs.  We believe what people want to see is real money and projects that actually benefit people.  Ultimately, the goal is to offer small value payment services that are “present everywhere, but important nowhere” to both not interfere with overarching monetary policy and ensure the smooth the functioning of digital payments in all scenarios. </h3>

<h2>Nooz</h2>
<p> Designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story. Engaged psychology and art history to build a business model and marketing plan around my undergraduate research.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
