		<h2>Push/Pull:  The Merchant-Bank Struggle for Control of Payments Systems</h2>

		<br>

		<h3>In recent years, the cost to merchants of accepting credit cards has spiked without a corresponding increase in the benefits.  Why is this?  The answer lies in a set of rules known as merchant restraints.  This essay argues that card network associations'  merchants restraints rules:  1) prevent merchants from steering consumers to cheaper payment options;  2) limit competition for payments by keeping all elements of payments process in the hands of card associations;  3) allow card networks to increase processing costs without any relation to their expenses;  4) force consumers to decide which payment systems to use based on the perceived benefits of bundled awards.  These anti-competitive practices of price-fixing and tying have left merchants increasingly dissatisfied with the structure of card networks' payment systems.  In response merchants' strategy has become to reduce payment acceptance costs.  Our project's goal is to make card networks' services less vital by quickly mapping a digital wallet payment at the register to an automated clearing house (ACH) network to take advantage of its low processing costs (less than 0.01 per transaction).  To get past the “chicken and egg” problem of needing a critical mass for out system to function our ACH based payment system funnels a portion of these payment processing cost savings  into a community asset trust.

<p> We designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story. I engaged psychology and art history to build a business model and marketing plan around my undergraduate research.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
