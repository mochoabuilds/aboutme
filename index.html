<h2>hi there!
<h2> my name is michael</h2>
<br/>
<br>
<h3>I was born in Chicago</h3>
<h3>and raised along its lakefront.</h3>

<br> 

<h3>I am an aspiring graudate student in Law & Economics
</h3>

<h3>My research focuses on the hidden human costs of the law's uniformity among stock markets in transition, national competition for shareholder corporate governance and the regulation of securities markets and consumer finance.
<br>

<h3>I previously founded <a href="https://las.illinois.edu/news/2014-10-01/seeds-success">Nooz</a> to give context to breaking news back in the days of iphone 6
</h3>

<h3>After that I worked as a publicist and <a href="https://www.hogsalt.com/">cook</a> in Chicago's West Loop (Maude's Liquor Bar)
</h3>


<h3>I then co-managed a staff of ten for a wholesale bakery and bustling neighborhood market for another <a href="https://www.goddessandgrocer.com/">group</a></h3>

<h3>Right now I'm preparing for graduate school</h3>

<h2>Nooz</h2>
<p>Led a group of computer engineering, architecture and graphic design students on a machine learning 
project. Designed a slick mobile app for iOS and Android that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The real-time news results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to unfolding news stories.</p>
