		<h2>THE INCOMPLETENESS OF LAW AROUND XYZ-TBD: A CROSS-COUNTRY ANALYSIS USING LITIGATION-PREP AI

		</h2>

		<p>As long as trees grow and water runs the law will not always keep up with technology.  Until we devise better ways of understanding the debates around xyz-tbd it'll be tremendously difficult for any of its legislation to have any teeth.  Especially if the public continues to view each legal action in isolation.  Its our goal to string these actions and history to synthesize changing ideologies in ways palatable to the public. 
		</p>

		<p>To our knowledge, the analysis of the precedents used to create rules of legal obligation around xyz-tbd has received little cross country analysis.  We believe precedents can tell us a great deal about about the way our government functions: about business, government relations, the role of business in our society and the way business responds to change. For that reason we comb through thousands of pages of precedents, using litigation-prep AI, for answers to our questions and hunches.  
		</p>

		<p>To boost our understanding of precedents this paper treats  them as a “flow of water” subject to the economic theories governing the formation and depreciation of capital.  This approach allows us to study the effects of details in law and generate hypotheses concerning precedents flow, total volume, “dry out” rate as well as interactions among these variables.  We are especially interested in exploring whether adherence to precedent has declined over time, particularly in a cross country analysis of different courts around the topic of xyz-tbd.  We also analyze the “drying up” of judicial decisions with those of administrative agency decisions, statues and constitutional provisions, to compare different courts, examine citation practices in briefs and examine this “drying out” question from a historical and citation standpoint. 
		</p>

		<p>The idea of a cross country analysis of judicial citations may strike others as an overwhelming endeavor, poorly suited for statistical aggregation.  Though we believe the extensive research and writing that judges, attorneys, law clerks, court clerks, jurors, witnesses and litigants have devoted to understanding precedents shows the weight they bring to decisions of similar circumstances.  Our methods may be described as follows:  first we translate data on precedents into citations to represent rules and standards and then interweave those citations into our “flow of water” framework to tests hypotheses.  This approach helps us better manage the endless tide of legal information and create a common language for discussion around the incompleteness of law surrounding xyz-tbd.   Especially as countries compete with each other on who's going to set the tone on its policy in the 21st century.
		</p>

		<p>	This paper is organized as follows. Part II describes a theory on the incompleteness of law. Part III describes how law is created and distinguishes between rules and standards.  Part IV summarizes major developments around xyz-tbd regulation.  Part V describes our court case samples, formalizes our “flow of water” framework, derives hypotheses and empirically analyzes the court case samples.  The final part of this paper, Part VI, put our theories into action with a prototype litigation-prep AI that extracts precedents from text and answers specific questions about its context.

<h2>Nooz</h2>
<p> We designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story. I engaged psychology and art history to build a business model and marketing plan around my undergraduate research.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
