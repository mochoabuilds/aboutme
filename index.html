		<h2>offline (cbdc)</h2>
		<br>

		<h3>A changeup in both technology and human nature has slowed the flow of physical cash. I envision future physical cash will come via "buying tickets to the county fair" directly from the central bank to ensure the security of central bank digital currency (cbdc), while still maintaining the benefits of offline payments.</h3>

		<h3>For better or worse, capital flows as payments are the financial's systems oxygen. When it flow freely, it does so unnoticed.  When it stops, soon enough everything else does as well. It's essential we make it easy to gain access to hard currency if / when disaster hits to speed recovery rates.</h3>

		<br>

		<h3>In coordination with central banks, my hope is to make it easier for neighborhoods to own the means of production, distribution and exchange of modern capital flows as payments.  My goal is to "ensure that obdc is present everywhere but important nowhere".</h3>

		<h3>This research provides blueprints for embedding a no questions asked offline monetary instrument (1:1 capital reserve w/USD) into a mobile interface along with supervisory and regulatory requirements.</h3>
