		The Incompleteness of Law Around Digital Wallets: A Cross-Country Analysis	
		</h2>

		<p>	It's the beginning of a new era in digital wallets.  Especially with legal order as it is today, in which lawmakers have moved more to general standards rather than specific rules, to apply legislation.  We see this approach to lawmaking almost like a faucet.  A small turn published decisions faucet – which defines the circumstances of cases and the specific rules of legal obligation applicable in similar circumstances – now produce big effects.
		</p>

		<p>What is unique about published decisions is that they are not explicit rules; instead they are merely the court's holding, that is, the minimum rule needed to explain the outcome of the case.  Though when pooled together these narrow court decisions –  a stream of holdings – form broad rules and standards.  This rules and standards form the basis for what the legal community calls a “precedent”. In simple terms, it's a past work of law that is called upon as reason for doing the same thing again.   
		</p>

		<p>In this paper an attempt will be made to develop a mathematical framework suited to understanding precedents in the dynamics of digital wallet regulation.  To our knowledge, the analysis of the precedents used to create rules of legal obligation around digital wallets has received little cross country analysis.  Methods will also be described for finding precedents similar to a given precedent in the countries chosen for analysis.

		</p>

		<p>The methods taken may be described as follows:  with countless cooks – lawyers, judges and law clerks – adding precedents to legal broth, crafting concise compete law becomes something of a confusing and inexact recipe.  It is for that reason we use the case citations appearing in judicial opinions as the basic data for our cross country analysis of digital wallet regulation.  Our analysis translates data on precedents into citations to represent rules and standards, and then interweaves those citations into a framework that pulls them apart with economic tools and summarize them for patterns.  The idea of analyzing judicial citation across countries may strike others as an overwhelming endeavor, poorly suited for statistical aggregation and irrelevant to an everyday person, but we believe the extensive research and writing that lawyers, judges and law clerks have devoted to understanding precedents shows the punching weight it brings to similar future legal obligations.  

		</p>

		<p>The notation is taken chiefly from symbolic logic.  Of the many systems in use we have chosen the simplest for our interpretation.  Some of the phrases, such as node, mesh, etc., are borrowed from ordinary network theory to mark the case citations appearing in judicial data.  This paper aims to demonstrate which precedents might be redundant and which might be most practical in a country's complex or unwieldy legal system.  Our idea is to influence the design of law and economics frameworks that are coming into existence as well as regulation that won't be written for at least another generation.

		</p>

		<p>This paper is organized as follows. Part II describes a theory on the incompleteness of law. Part III describes ex ante versus ex post creations of the law and distinguishes between rules and standards.  Part IV summarizes contemporary advances in digital wallet regulation.  Part V describes our notation, fundamental theorems and court case samples that we summarize for principal characteristics of citations.  Within this section we also develop the framework for understanding how to use case citations to study the effects of details in law.  We then draw conclusions from readily available court data to showcase the patterns and possible future of digital wallet regulation.  The final part of this paper, Part VI, put our theories into action within a reliable reproducible digital wallet and suggests areas for future research across other principles, precedents and art.

<h2>Nooz</h2>
<p> We designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story. I engaged psychology and art history to build a business model and marketing plan around my undergraduate research.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
