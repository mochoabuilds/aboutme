		<h2>A Program for Monetary Reform</h2>

		<h3>approximately 800 words on the idea</h3>

		<h3>Throughout economic history no problem has been more passionately discussed than money.  Yet, as scholars have shown, money's generation does not operate as many people think it does.  This academic debate on its origins ultimately drives a discussion on who should control its issuance. We understand this problem is not simple.  Historical accidents, powerful political forces and network effects have ensured only a select few can issue money and credit.  Having this head start has allowed established banks to enjoy tremendous success and spectacular failure over the centuries. We believe some of these highs and lows could be tempered by separating the provision of  payments from the provision of fiance (i.e.  money's issuance and credit).  Under this backdrop, we describe a blueprint for “two window banking” that sees regulatory goals as more of a reflexive, iterative and dialogical process.  Our goal is to give regulator agencies an umbrella framework under to deploy informal regulatory strategies that more flexibly deal with new industry problems as they arise.  Our blueprint may feel radical, but it is so because we envision a world in which “two window banks” are ready to provide banking services in the event of systemically important financial institutions failure.
		</h3>
		
		<h3>This paper hashes out the system architecture, flowcharts of general processes and regulatory goals for a “two window bank”.  It details our challenges, why we built it the way we did and what we learned on the way. We assume the reader has basic knowledge of:  narrow banking, stablecoins, bank runs, the moral hazards of deposit insurance, monetary policy, fractional reserve banking, regulatory sandboxes, commercial law and software design. However ,we include an appendix to seed that foundational knowledge.  In this paper we detail why our “two window bank” separates the functions of a bank into those of utility (i.e.  holding customers ACH to stablecoin deposits, for use at frequent interaction retailers, in an immediately redeemable reserve 100% equal to their deposits) and risk window (e.g.  lending activities with other assets and equity capital).  To show how our platform is “present everywhere, but important nowhere” to not interfere with monetary policy, we focus on a limited customer base (community where money circulates locally at higher rates than average) and incorporating non-traditional elements (reinvesting cost savings into a community asset trust – what people want to see is real money and projects that actual benefit people in their community) we aim to show how “two window banking” strengthens the liquidity of systemically important financial utilities such as payments and lending.  The hope is to show how our proof of concept better connects the information, people and technology needed to process payments and issue money in normal periods and times of stress. 
		</h3>

		<h3>With memories of past financial crises losing salience, the combination of time and the capitalistic engine have created new markets.  But we cannot say that all this innovation is 'good' simply because there is a market for it.  We believe regulation of new markets must remain an iterative process between private parties and regulators.  First and foremost, this process could borrow from the body of “law and political economy” to design broad aspirational outcome-focused principles designed to benefit the broadest group of people.  To test these regulatory principles we propose the creation of a “regulatory sandbox”.  There regulators can gather valuable understanding of new technologies as well as train the next generation of financial/algorithm regulators.  Within this sandbox private parties and regulators can tests ideas and make adjustments on a small scale, and better accompany the perspective and detailed rule making mechanisms that make it possible for lawmaking to move. Principles that could guide a regulatory sandbox include:  consumer protection, financial stability and collective trust.  Enforcing principles as these will depend on a range of circumstances for compliance.    More importantly, having this sandbox offers us the hope we can build tools that reflect our values and mobilize against the intensifying inequality, racial injustice and ecological destruction sometimes brought on by conventional banking.  We believe a regulatory sandbox for to test “two window banking” allows us to keep the capitalistic engine in motion, by changing a small part of the economic structure from within, incessantly chipping away at the old one, incessantly creating a new one.  This positive force is an engine for improvement and economic growth.  The future of money, banking and payment belongs to whomever can jigsaw together the integration needed to unify the compliance stack and connect it to an aesthetically pleasing front end.

<p>Nooz</p>
<p> Engaged psychology and art history to build a business model around my undergraduate research. Designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
