		<h2>A Program for Two Window Banking</h2>

		<h3>Throughout history no economic problem has been more vigorously discussed than the money problem. We understand this problem is not simple.  Relying too heavily on theoretical knowledge will keep us stagnant.  We must turn to to a different approach, one modeled after nature's processes of trial and error.  Our goal is to better align bankers incentives with society's preferences for full production and full employment, but we now theories aren't enough.  Practical experience – the kind only trial and error can bring drives our methods. The following pages outline the insights, technical architecture and ongoing effort of our team to build a proof of concept of a “two window bank”.  We believe the money problem could be stabilized by separating the provision of money, from the provision of finance.  The hope is to show financial regulators how “two window banking” allows money to be “present everywhere, but important nowhere” to not interfere with monetary policy. 	
		</h3>
		
		<h3>The paper details our successes and challenges, why we built our proof of concept and what we learned on the way.  Our hope is it offer a light to those seeking to experiment on their own or simply understand these concepts on a deeper level.  We assume the reader has a basic knowledge of banks runs, fractional reserve banking, deposit insurance, narrow banking, commercial law and software design.  However, we include an appendix to help build that foundational knowledge.  Following this introduction, we will detail a proof of concept for a “two-window bank”:  the first window is a utility window (i.e. requiring banks to hold 100% reserves on demand deposits, thus making deposit insurance unnecessary).  The second window represents risk (i.e. lending activities such as buy now pay later, etc).  As we describe the proof of concept, we provide:  an answer to some of the most basic questions, functional diagrams, goals for each window, a legal basis drawn from commercial law principles, insights and lessons learned.  While right now the right regulatory model for “two window banking” is not yet known, one thing is clear. Aligning bankers incentives with society's preferences for full production and full employment is absolutely essential.

<p> Engaged psychology and art history to build a business model around my undergraduate research. Designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
