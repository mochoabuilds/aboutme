Towards Sustainable Development
</h2>

		<br>

		<h3>Some words on the matter..</h3>

		<br>

		<h3>So what is trade?
		</h3>
		
		<h3>What is money?
		</h3>

		<h3>Who creates money?   
		</h3>	

		<h3>Why does it matter who creates money?
		</h3>

		<h3>How have commercial banks invisibly built up a legal structure that damages the core mechanisms money is supposed to deliver to society?
		</h3>

		<h3>What are regulators doing about this inequitable legal structure?</h3>

		<h3>What is this paper doing about this inequitable legal structure?</h3>

		<h3>What can readers expect from this paper?</h3>

		<h3>What really excites us about “two window banking”?</h3>

		<h3>Potential Risks and Methods to Address Them</h3>

		<h3>Where could “two window banks” be safely tested?</h3>

<p>Nooz</p>
<p> Engaged psychology and art history to build a business model around my undergraduate research. Designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
