		<h2>INSIDE A JUDGE'S MIND:  DID JUDICIAL STRESS AND ITS EFFECTS ON JUDICIAL REPUTATION POLITICIZE THE BENCH DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC?
		</h2>

		<p>Imagine you are a judge...  It's easy when there is a precedent on point; you follow it.  But what do you do when new activity emerges and the rights and duties of the people engaged are unclear?  As a judge you'll want to do a good job, so your judgment is cast not on the basis of personal choice but of technical legal judgment.  But given the vastness of law and its extension into all sorts of controversial areas it's inevitable some of your decisions will be based on personal choice.  This is what makes being a judge difficult.  Thankfully your legal training and integrity prevent you from serving up judgment that politicizes the bench.  Your commitment to the courts is what makes the law work.  This essay explores what makes the law not work.  We claim that judicial stress (i.e. backlogged courts and thoughts of morality stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic) and its effect on judicial reputation (measured as a judge's record of citations and rates of reversal when deviating from precedent) politicized the bench during the pandemic.</p>

<h2>Nooz</h2>
<p> We designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story. I engaged psychology and art history to build a business model and marketing plan around my undergraduate research.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
