		<h2>A Program for Two Window Banking</h2>

		<h3>Throughout history no economic problem has been more vigorously discussed than the money problem. We understand this problem is not simple.  Aligning bankers incentives with society's preferences for full production and full employment is a daunting task.  We believe the money problem could be stabilized by separating the provision of money, from the provision of finance.  For this purpose, we propose “two-window banking” because it separates the functions of banks into those of utility (i.e.  requires banks to hold 100% reserves on demand deposits, thus making deposit insurance unnecessary) and riskier activities (i.e.  lending activities such as buy now pay later, etc).  In this paper an attempt is made to answer some of the most basic questions arising around “two window banking”; and argue that there may be circumstances, in the face of shocks, it would be more stable than traditional banking.    The hope is to show government regulators how “two window banking” allows money to be “present everywhere, but important nowhere” to not interfere with monetary policy.  	
		</h3>
		
		<h3>We view current systems of money and banking as unstable because governments have allowed commercial banks to create almost all the money in the economy. Current systems give commercial banks the power to increase or decrease the volume of circulating money by throttling bank loans and investments.  This approach, known as fractional reserve banking creates an inverted pyramid - an abundance of credit and expansion in the money supply during times of boom and contraction of credit and money supply in times of bust - that leaves market economies unstable.  It is this setup, that compels banks to lend and owe multiples of money of which they must have on hand if depositors were to ask for withdrawals, introducing only more instability.  Since fractional reserve banking hinders the stability of circulating money it could be said the utility window of “two window banking” better meets depositors obligations for 100% withdrawals if they should all ask for it simultaneously.  The 100% requirement, in effect, completely separates banking from riskier lending practices.   
		</h3>	
		
		<h3>Another instability of current systems is the cozy backstop deposit insurance has created for commercial banks.  With central banks role as lender of last resort the once unstable nature of fractional reserve banking suddenly becomes accepted lawful practice.   Though the true Achilles of heel of current systems is when the efficient functioning of payments mechanisms breaks down.  If the free exchange of payment for goods and services on which people depend on for their livelihoods stops, then in utter desperation people become more willing to hand over their liberties in promise of economic security.  That is why we must address the root problems of the money, banking and payments; not just postpone the next turmoil.
		</h3>
		
		<h3>While for now the right regulatory model for “two window banking” is not yet known, one thing is clear.  Aligning bankers incentives with society's preferences for full production and full employment is essential.

<p> Engaged psychology and art history to build a business model around my undergraduate research. Designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
