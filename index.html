		<h2>HOW THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AFFECTED THE LEGAL PROCEDURES USED BY COURTS (AND HOW “PERSONALIZED RULE” COULD ADVANCE THE LAW) 
		</h2>

		<p>	Imagine you are a judge.  How do you reach decisions?  It's easy when there is a law, statute or precedent on point; you follow it.  But what happens when the law is unclear or in flux?  Your judgment is based on logic and reasoning, not personal choice.  This judicial restraint – solidified by years of legal training and the rule of law – ensures your personal choices don't dominate considerations of law, statute or precedent.  This is what makes the law work.  This essay explores how the law worked during the COVID-19 pandemic.
		</p>

		<p>	Scholars often scrutinize the way judges are politically motivated or biased.  This focus on judicial failing makes judges seem worse than they are.  Surprisingly, it turn out few scholars have considered how the pandemic affected the legal procedures used by courts.  We present an empirical study of the legal procedures used by litigants and courts to dispute cases around the world.  Disputes we explore include: the eviction of a tenant for non-payment of rent and the collecting of a bounced check.  The idea is to build an index of how each nation resolved these disputes before, during and after the pandemic.
		</p>

		<p>Our empirical research shows that the pandemic has unexpectedly led cases of eviction and collections growing closer to the public's sense of justice.  Viewing this from a comparative law perspective leads us to conclude that the courts should be extended to include the experimental legal paradigm of “personalized rule” – at least as far as eviction and collection cases.

<h2>Nooz</h2>
<p> We designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story. I engaged psychology and art history to build a business model and marketing plan around my undergraduate research.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
