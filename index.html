		<h2>designing central bank digital currency to flexibly accomodate regulatory change (2022)</h2>

		<h3>Before the pandemic hit cash was king.  But these days at the register there's more cashless signs than ever.  To counter the declining use of cash governments around the world have been developing their own central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) akin to cash.  But extending the best properties of cash – instant and final settlement, user friendliness and universal access – to a digital instrument will be no easy task. Connecting CBDCs to legal financial systems, without upending the financial system, will be even messier.  Especially with the law itself pointing to more than one agency as the principal decision maker.  Ultimately, the blueprint for designing a CBDC payment infrastructure will require three things:  a deep understanding of regulatory compliance, the engineering talent to execute and the business savvy to turn it into a successful product.  The future of money, banking and payments belongs to whomever can make this hat trick happen.

<p> Engaged psychology and art history to build a business model around my undergraduate research. Designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
