		<h2>A Program for Monetary Reform</h2>

		<h3>800 words on the idea</h3>

		<h3>Throughout economic history no problem has been more passionately discussed than money.  Yet, as scholars have shown, money's generation and credit does not operate as many people think it does.  Why does this matter?  Problems arise from theories that too rigidly rigidly separate the “economy” from society and politics.  We understand this problem is not simple.  Historical accidents, powerful political forces and network effects have ensured only a select few established banks can generate money and credit.  This organizing model downplays considerations of distribution and makes “efficiency” be seen as neutral.  The shortcoming of this is that it  reproduces priority for the privileged banks that accentuates inequality.  It has also allowed established banks to enjoy tremendous success and spectacular failure, at the expense of the public, over the centuries.  What are regulators doing about it?  New bodies of scholarship are emerging to challenge this approach of only a few being able to issue money and seeing “efficiency” as neutral.  Law and political economy  is now exploring a wider variety of legal fields to mobile against this intensifying inequality in banking.  The goal is to give regulator agencies an umbrella framework under to deploy reflexive and iterative regulatory strategies that more flexibly deal with new industry problems as they arise.  Under this backdrop, we describe a blueprint for “two window banking” that separates the provision of  payments from the provision of finance (i.e.  money's issuance and credit).  Our blueprint may feel radical, but it is so because we envision a world in which “two window banks” rebuild community-level social capital and strengthen the liquidity of systemically important financial utilities. 
		</h3>
		
		<h3>What readers can expect from this paper?  This paper hashes out the system architecture, flowcharts of general processes and regulatory principles for a “two window bank”.  It details our challenges, why we built it the way we did and what we learned on the way. We assume the reader has basic knowledge of:  narrow banking, the moral hazards of deposit insurance, fractional reserve banking, stablecoins, monetary policy, regulatory sandboxes, commercial law and software design. However, we include an appendix to seed that foundational knowledge.  In this paper we detail why our “two window bank” separates the functions of a bank into those of utility (i.e.  holding customers ACH to stablecoin deposits, for use at frequent interaction retailers, in an instantly redeemable reserve 100% equal to their deposits) and risk window (i.e.   lending activities with other assets and equity capital).  To not interfere with monetary policy we make our platform “present everywhere, but important nowhere” by focusing on a limited customer base(e.g.  communities where money circulates at higher rates than average, small volume purchases, areas with little to no data center space) and incorporating non-traditional elements (e.g.   offline payments, reinvesting cost savings into a community asset trust because what people want to see is real money and projects that actual benefit people in their community).   Our goal is to show how this platform better connects the information, people and technology needed to process payments, issue money and provide credit in both normal periods and times of stress.  We believe the future of money, banking and payment belongs to whomever can jigsaw together the integration needed to unify the regulatory stack and connect it to an aesthetically pleasing front end.

		<h3>What is the role of regulation in democratizing banking?  What is the underlying theory of democratizing banking?   The combination of time and the capitalistic engine have created new markets in money, banking and payments.  Tho we cannot say that all this innovation is 'good' just because there is a market for it.  Regulation of new markets must remain an iterative process between private parties and regulators.  We believe the regulatory process could borrow from scholarship in “law and political economy” to design aspirational outcome-focused principles designed to benefit the broadest group of people.  To test these regulatory principles we propose the creation of a “regulatory sandbox”.  Within this sandbox private parties and regulators could gather valuable understanding of new technologies, test ideas and make adjustments on a small scale.  This iterative process makes it possible for regulation to better accompany the prescriptive and detailed rule making mechanisms needed to make lawmaking to move. Principles that could guide entry into a regulatory sandbox include a focus on:  consumer protection, financial stability and collective trust.  We believe a regulatory sandbox for testing  our “two window banking” platform would allow us to keep the capitalistic engine in motion, by changing a small part of the economic structure from within,  incessantly chipping away at the old one and collectively creating a new one.  More importantly, this sandbox offers us hope we can build tools that reflect our values, train the next generation of financial/algorithm regulators and mobilize against the intensifying inequality, racial and gendered injustice and ecological destruction brought on by conventional banking.

<p> Engaged psychology and art history to build a business model around my undergraduate research. Designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
