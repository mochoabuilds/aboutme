		<h2>A Program for Two Window Banking</h2>

		<h3>Throughout economic history no problem has been more vigorously discussed than money.  Any discussion of its origins is not just of academic interest, it's a debate on its politics, which in turn drives the discussion on who should control its issuance.  We understand this problem is not simple. Relying too heavily on theoretical knowledge will keep us in the same silos.  Practical experiments– the kind only trial and error can bring drives our questions and methods. We believe the money problem could be stabilized by separating the provision of payments, from the provision of finance. The following pages outline the insights, technical architecture and ongoing effort of our team to design a proof of concept for a “two window bank”. Our broader purpose is to show how this de novo bank allows money to be “present everywhere, but important nowhere” to better fit the monetary policy goals of regulators.
		</h3>
		
		<h3>This paper details our successes and challenges, why we built our proof of concept and what we learned on the way.  We assume the reader has a basic knowledge of banks runs, fractional reserve banking, deposit insurance, narrow banking, commercial law and software design. However, we include an appendix to help build that foundational knowledge. Following this introduction, we will detail a proof of concept that separates the functions of a bank into those of utility (i.e.  requires banks to hold reserves 100% equal to demand deposits to be default free when conducting online/offline payments) and those of riskier activities (i.e. lending activities with other assets and equity capital).  Our proof of concept embeds both functions into a mobile interface along with supervisory and regulatory requirements to trim compliance costs and cut out superfluous value extracting middlemen.  Cost savings derived from transaction revenue are then channeled into a community asset trust to cultivate social capital.   By targeting a limited customer base and incorporating non-traditional elements we hope to show how “two window banking” strengthens the liquidity of systemically important financial utilities.  To illuminate the richest features of our proof of concept we provide:  our experiments with learning the technology, test features critical to central bank services and validation of its inexpensive operations.  
		</h3>

		<h3>While the right model for “two window banking” is still being cooked up, one thing is clear.  Scholars have largely neglected the intersection of finance, regulation and technology that is transforming the financial system, and society more broadly. The most valuable research will consider how to better enforce central banks terms closer to the ground, while staying in step with laws and responding to societal preferences.

<p> Engaged psychology and art history to build a business model around my undergraduate research. Designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
