		<h2>XYZ-TBD'S LEGAL PRECEDENTS: A THEORETICAL AND EMPRICIAL ANALYSIS</h2>

		<p>As long as plants grow and water runs change will continue to outpace law.  There is a real need for some precedent.  But what exactly is a precedent?  In simple terms, it's a past work of law that is called upon as reason for doing the same thing again.  Its a decision of a court that carries a special legal significance as it rests in a decision being regarded as having a practical, not just theoretical, authority over the content of the law. Ultimately this gives courts a limited power to make law within broader legal frameworks.  The assumption underlying this is that the law is sometimes incomplete and in need of greater specificity to keep pace with our changing society.  For that reason precedents also give courts the limited power to make law in our sometimes incomplete world.
		</p>

		<p>To our knowledge, the analysis of precedents used to make rules of legal obligation around xyz-tbd has received little cross country analysis.  Our idea is to bring an infusion of the latest thinking of law and economics to courts and bring new perspectives to judges and legislators perhaps isolated from the new happening going on at universities.  We believe if we don't devise better ways of understanding the precedents driving these debates then it'll tremendously difficult for future legislation to have any teeth.  To take on this problem of the incompleteness of law around xyz-tbd we first pull it apart, break it down to its logical components and then analyze it to inform decision process that impact populations.
		</p>

		<p>This paper develops a “flow of water” approach for the analysis of legal precedents.  We begin by formulating a model of optimal “water level” for its production, and then use this model to generate hypothesis regarding precedents rate of “replenishment”, size of reservoir, its rate of “drought” and the interaction among these variables.   Because of the uniqueness of our approach to precedent analysis of xyz-tbd, we develop the “flow of water” model in more detail in sections that follow.  
		</p>

		<p>We believe the nature of this incompleteness of law problem sometimes causes us to underestimate how quickly change occurs once its reaches inflection points and begins accelerating.  The “flow of water” framework helps us anticipate this change.  Its used to explore the relationship between:  (1) the “drought” vs “replenishment” rate of precedents; (2) the changing demographics of a court systems geographical population; (3) and judicial ideology (measured by the average percentage of liberal policy decisions on xyz-tbd topics measured on a scale from one to five).  The goal is explore at what population size do different levels of court begin to grow inflexible regarding how frequently they reference precedents outside their ideology.  More specifically, does this pattern differ across nations?  
		</p>

		<p>The idea of a cross country analysis of precedents may strike others as an overwhelming endeavor, poorly suited for statistical aggregation.  So why bother?  We believe the issue can be illuminated by our empirical analysis.  Judges, law clerks, attorneys, court clerks, jurors, witnesses and litigants have provided us the useful first step in understanding precedents.  The second step requires us measuring the “flows” of legal precedents, and combining these measures with data on citations to estimate and test our hypotheses.  All together both will help us more easily create a common language for discussion around where society may want legislation to go/should go in view of change and market forces around the incompleteness of law around xyz-tbd.
		</p>

		<p>This paper is organized as follows. Part II describes a theory on the incompleteness of law and distinguishes between rules and standards.  Part III summarizes major developments around precedent analysis.  Part IV describes our court case samples.  Part V formalizes our “flow of water” framework and derives hypotheses.  Part VI empirically analyzes the court case samples and draws conclusions.  The final part of this paper, Part VII, suggest areas for future research.</p>

<h2>Nooz</h2>
<p> We designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story. I engaged psychology and art history to build a business model and marketing plan around my undergraduate research.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
