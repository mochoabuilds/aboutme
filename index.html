		<h2>HOW GROWING CASELOAD AND THE WAY JUDGES BEHAVE LEAD TO THE LAW NOT WORKING AS IT SHOULD & THE PROMISE OF 'PERSONALIZED RULE' </h2>

		<p>Imagine you are a judge.  It's easy when there is a precedent or statue on point; you follow it.  But what do you do when a new activity emerges, and the rights and duties of the people engaged are unclear?  Good judges will make decisions not on the basis of personal choices but judicial philosophy, case facts and previous case precedent.  Yet given the vastness of law and its extension into all sorts of controversial areas it's inevitable some decisions will fall back on personal choices.  This is what makes judging difficult.  
		</p>

		<p>	What should be done?  The best defense is for the courts, which encompass the judiciary, its staff and technological resources, to do their job well.  That is, articulate well-reasoned persuasive explanations for their decisions.  This protects the courts from serving up offensive judgment deprived of persuasion and reasoning, the kind of decisions that destroy our faith in judicial systems.  Such defense is what makes the law work.  
		</p>

		<p>This essay explores what causes the law not to work.  We believe some procedural practices in the federal courts don't support the judges as squarely as we'd like.  Our empirical research shows that heavy caseload, coupled with the way judges behave within the federal court of appeals, has unexpectedly led to the law not working as it should, and why it should therefore be extended to include 'personalized rule'.  
		</p>

		<p>To put readers in the right mindset to absorb and agree with our theory we first construct the basic frame - which gives readers the legal and factual framework to understand what follows... Once again, imagine you are a judge.  A new activity has arose (e.g. transportation by autonomous taxi) and the rights and duties of the people engaged are uncertain.  Those rights and duties will therefore be constructed by analogy to the rights and duties of people engaged in similar activities (e.g. transportation by taxi), but analogy is an inexact method for generating legal rules.  The resulting uncertainty generates litigation, in which the rights and duties of those involved in the new activity will be hashed out, reducing legal uncertainty and litigation in the next cycle.  
		</p>

		<p>However if the activity is changing (e.g. transportation by autonomous air taxi), the lull in litigation will create new legal uncertainty because the old precedents will not be perfectly adapted to the new legal activities, and so in the next period there will be more litigation again.  Of course, you as the judge follow these procedural practices, but personal choices inevitably play a role when the law leaves gaps.  Judicial efficiency then becomes a weight you put in the balance when making your decisions.  The heavier the caseload, the heavier this weight will be.  Our argument is that this is what makes the law not work as it should.     
		</p>

		<p>With the law looking unsound, we wonder what the answer is.  To further illustrate our theoretical argument let's consider a scenario... Advances in competition, privacy, financial services, consumer protection or anything new, have the same basic operational problem in dealing with change:  change tends to happen more quickly than judicial decisions cycles, and in parallel, change creates a heavier caseload for the courts.  Our claim is that few scholars have considered how often the courts fail to recognize their duty of weighing considerations of social advantage when burdened by heavy caseload; especially where advances leave the law unclear or in flux.</p>

		<p>Surprisingly, it turn out that few scholar have considered how heavy caseload, coupled with the way judges behave within the federal court of appeals, has unexpectedly led to the law not working as it should, and why it should therefore be extended to include 'personalized rule'.  While a blunt solution, 'personalized rule' - defined as precision law characterized by the two primary features of individualization and machine-sorted information - creates additional capacity within the courts.  It's a capacity that could help judges better balance considerations of social advantage when burdened by heavy caseload.</p>

		<p>Some may disagree with our theory and solution, and this essay explores why they are wrong.  We confront the other sides arguments and criticisms, and describe why the benefits of 'personalized rule'  outweigh its costs.  We show how 'personalized rule' has the potential to outperform discretionary enforcement practices.  We also consider what will happen if our theory and solution is accepted.</p>

<h2>Nooz</h2>
<p> We designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story. I engaged psychology and art history to build a business model and marketing plan around my undergraduate research.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
