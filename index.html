<p>Developer Statement</p>
I'm a true Chicagoan, with wide ranging interests.  Trained as a sociologist before turning to the development of software and hardware, I build technology with a more intuitive approach, distinguished from the highly systemic and science-based theories used by many CS/ECE graduates.  Instead I embrace connections between our five senses and code to harmonize or enhance day-to-day life.  Abandoning reference to historical user experience design, I've created simple and elegant forms that have been consumed on a broader scale, bringing “good design” to anyone with a smartphone.  My hope is to bring fantasy and invention to computer vision applications (and front-end development).<br/>
<br/>
I see the possibilities of computer vision's mass production and have developed my own small factory, equipped with the latest machines and methods to streamline software and hardware development.  My computer vision applications are conceived as a piece of mini-architecture.  My current machine forges a link between the sinuous curves of the late 19th century's Aesthetic movement and Japanese art and design.
