		<h2>RULES AND STANDARDS AROUND DIGITAL WALLETS:  
			A CROSS-COUNTRY COMPARISON</h2>

		<br>

		<h3>With social and legal order as it today, in which lawmaking bodies have moved to general standards rather than specific rules, the published decisions of courts and governments agencies are essential sources of specific rules of law.  These published decisions define the circumstances of cases and create the specific rules of legal obligation applicable in similar scenarios.  
		</h3> 

		<h3>Though what the court decides is unique in that it's not a rule; instead its merely the court's holding, that is the minimum rule needed to explain the outcome of the case.  Though when strung together these court decisions – a weaving of words – can form a decisional rule that is general enough to be inferred.  The legal community calls this a “precedent”, something done in the past that is called to as a reason for doing the same thing again.   
		</h3>

		<h3>The use of precedents to create standards and rules around digital wallets, to our knowledge, has received little cross-country theoretical or empirical analysis.  Our methods treat the legal precedents created by court decisions as a flow of information whose tap sometimes runs dry over time as new conditions arise that were not foreseen by the framers of existing precedents. We believe the writing and research of lawyers, judges and law clerks allow this tap to remain flowing and precedents to enter into the decisions of cases. Ultimately it's how a legal system can best give content to the law. 
		</h3>

		<h3>The paper is organized as follows. Part II describes our court case samples and presents tables summarizing the principal characteristics of precedent citations.  Part III provides a historical perspective on digital wallets. Part IV concerns the stages of legal rule making, how a legal system can best give content to the law and the allocation of rule making responsibilities. Within Part V we discuss a framework for analyzing the effects of details in laws, give structure to our data sets concerning courts and judges, derive hypotheses and discuss the production of precedents.  Part VI develops techniques for using case citations to study precedents empirically and shows how rules and standards are not driven entirely by public preference. Part VII examines the creation of law and content in terms of legal costs and the extent to which individual's behaviors conform. The final part, Part VIII, suggest some areas for future research using the approach developed here as well as a design report for a digital wallet.

<p> We designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story. I engaged psychology and art history to build a business model and marketing plan around my undergraduate research.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
