		The Incompleteness of Law Around Artificial Intelligence: A Cross-Country Analysis	
		</h2>

		<p>It is always frustrating when you realize the law does not always keep up with technology.  No one likes meeting victims and saying 'we can't help you'.  Currently legal precedent involving artificial intelligence is slim.  The few laws that currently govern the technology are mostly new.  Within limit precedent, lawmakers around the world are sleuthing for test cases to mimic or reject.  The laws are certainly coming, but we don't know what they are just yet. Until we devise better ways to detect deep-fakes it'll be tremendously difficult for any legislation to have any teeth.  For now it is too soon to predict even rough sketches of regulations to protect consumers and contain the spread of disinformation. 
		</p>

		<p>The artificial intelligence scene is a fascinating place for global politics, because countries are competing with each other on who's going to set the tone.  To our knowledge, the analysis of precedents used to create rules of legal obligation around artificial intelligence has received little cross country theoretic and empirical analysis.	  This paper views these precedents as a flow of water.  Our focus is on measuring these flows and blending these measures with data on judicial citations to estimate and test hypotheses concerning the “drying up” of these precedent flows.  We argue that precedents lose value over time due to changing socioeconomic conditions, legislation and judicial personnel as they reduce the flow of information  to a precedent.  We are devoted to creating a common language, empirical framework and discussion of the open problems around the incompleteness of law around artificial intelligence, especially deep-fakes.
		</p>

		<p>The idea of a cross country analysis of judicial citations across countries may strike others as an overwhelming endeavor, poorly suited for statistical aggregation.  Though we believe the extensive research and writing that judges, attorneys, law clerks, court clerks, jurors, witnesses and litigants have devoted to understanding precedents shows the weight they bring to the decisions of similar cases.  Our methods may be described as follows:  with countless cooks – lawyers, judges, law clerks and more – adding precedents to legal broth, crafting concise compete law becomes something of a confusing and inexact recipe.  It is for that reason we comb  thru case citations appearing in judicial opinions as the basic data for our cross country analysis of artificial intelligence regulation.  Our analysis translates data on precedents into citations to represent rules and standards, and then interweaves those citations into a framework that further studies them with tools of law and economics to summarize differences. 
		</p>

		<p>This paper is organized as follows. Part II describes a theory on the incompleteness of law. Part III describes ex ante versus ex post creations of the law and distinguishes between rules and standards.  Part IV summarizes major developments in the evolution of artificial intelligence regulation.  Part V describes our symbolic notation, court case samples and presents tables summarizing the principal characteristics of citations.  Within this section we also develop the framework for understanding how to use case citations to study the effects of details in artificial intelligence law.  We formalize our model, derive hypotheses and discuss the production of precedents and apply it to the evolution of less costly to enforce artificial intelligence regulation. The final part of this paper, Part VI, put our theories into action within a prototype deep-fake detector and suggests areas for future research using the framework developed here.

<h2>Nooz</h2>
<p> We designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story. I engaged psychology and art history to build a business model and marketing plan around my undergraduate research.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
