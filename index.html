		<h2>designing cbdc with a cash-like privacy</h2>

		<h3>Before the panini hit cash was king.  But these days at the register there are more cashless signs then ever. Sensing this, governments around the world have been designing their own central bank digital currency (cbdc) akin to cash.  Tho filling in this outstanding gap in digital money, banking and payments will be no easy task. Replicating people's perception of cash will require central banks to pull off quite the hat trick. They will need to design their cbdb with: a huge degree of a anonymity in transactions, rigorous regulatory infrastructure and support for offline/online payments.
		</h3>

		<h3>Right now governments around the world are hashing out their options for cbdc. At the heart of my graduate research is defining whom will distribute cbcd "closer to the ground".  Whomever this entity is will have an outsized influence in how digital money, banking and payments evolves. My research aims to show how central banks stand to gain from choosing established essential retailers as local distributors of cbdc. To make people feel safer and finesse higher rates of cbdc adoption essential retailers could be asked to: on-board accounts, exchange fiat currency for cbdc, authorize payments, ensure anti-money laundering compliance, etc. The goal is to extend people's understanding of cbdc at a familiar spot that already gets them through the day.
		</h3>

		<h3>Ultimately my goal is to prototype software for essential retailers to allocate and manage cbdc "closer to the ground", and give central banks more time to focus on their core duties of independent monetary policy.  My hope is to help governments around the world flexibly accommodate today's technology needs and regulatory requirements – and tomorrow's – policy goals.

<p> Engaged psychology and art history to build a business model for my undergraduate research. Designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news inflation pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
