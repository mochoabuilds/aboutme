		<h2>Push/Pull:  The Merchant-Card Network Struggle for Control of Payments Systems</h2>

		<br>

		<h3>In recent years, the cost to merchants of accepting credit cards has spiked without a corresponding increase in the benefits.  Why is this?  The answer lies in a set of rules known as merchant restraints.  This essay argues that these rules:  1) prevent merchants from steering consumers to cheaper payment options;  2) limit competition for payments;  3) allow card networks to increase processing costs without any relation to their expenses;  4) force consumers to decide which payment systems to use based upon the perceived benefits of a credit cards reward programs.  These  practices have left merchants dissatisfied with credit cards and its law dislodged from the social preferences of citizens.  We believe legal intervention is required.   To ensure our legal analysis remains disciplined our analysis focuses on generating testable predictions to demonstrate casual connections between legal rules and outcomes.  We do this by exploring the evolution of contract and tort law in relation to digital wallet payments and analyzing and the legislative response posed by this evolving market to estimate structural parameters.  Our goal is expose the costs and benefits of each outcome and optimize  across various legal strategies to maximize welfare across its many definitions.  The essay culminates with a financial technology sandbox application for a consumer payment processing system that  bridges increasingly popular digital wallets into an automated clearing house network to spare merchants the 2 to 3% fee commonly charged by card networks for payment processing.

<p> We designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story. I engaged psychology and art history to build a business model and marketing plan around my undergraduate research.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
