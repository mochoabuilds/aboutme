		<h2>A Program for Two Window Banking</h2>

		<h3> No well informed person would pretend that our current democracy is perfect.  The great challenge we face today is making what we call democracy work.  After the storming of the US Capitol on January 6th, 2021 no one can doubt that democracy is threatened.  Tho the real danger lies less in the misinformation swirling on the internet than in the existence of millions of unemployed workers, idle machines and people living paycheck-to-paycheck.  On such a stage the propaganda of January 6th will only swell.</h3>

		<h3>Sometimes capitalism gets things, big things, really wrong and its essential we have safety nets to protect against failures of the current system. The important objective, therefore, is to design our banking system so that it empowers our most marginalized workers and resources to the fullest extent.  Tho ensuring that our labor, material and capital operates to the fullest capacity is like shooting at a moving target.  We understand that our problems are not simple.  In this paper an attempt is made to answer some of the basic questions that arise around “two window banking”; and argue that there may be circumstances, in the face of shocks, it would be more stable than traditional banking.  Our goal is show how “two window banking” can fit in with the policy goals of regulators, by providing, through history, economic models, legal research and a proof of concept, a formal introduction to its main features.</h3>

		<h3>Throughout history no economic problem has been more vigorously discussed than the money problem. “Two window banking” is intended to curb the lawless nature of our supply of circulating money.  We see current banking systems as unstable because governments have allowed commercial banks to create almost all the money in the economy, and then were forced to insure banks with deposit insurance to ensure they could continue manipulating the supply of money supply to their benefit.  This approach, known as fractional reserve banking creates an inverted pyramid (i.e.  an abundance of credit and expansion of the money supply in times of boom, and contraction of credit and money supply in times of bust) that leaves market economies unstable.  In other cases when money and democracy really breaks down, its the payments system, among other things, that breaks down first.  If the free exchange of payment for goods and services on which people depend on for their livelihoods stops, then in utter desperation people become willing to hand over their liberties in promise of economic security.  While reforms have been adopted the past few years to catch this fall they remain patchwork, leaving the basic democratic structure unsound.</h3>
			
		<h3>In dissecting this problem (of how to empower our most fragile workers and resources to the fullest extent), we find seeing it as a test kitchen to be helpful.  By having software designers, economists and lawyers develop prototypes together we can quickly deconstruct main features into modular parts that better fit the policy goals of regulators.  This is especially significant with regulation and payment systems differing around the world.  For example, in some Latin American countries, the majority of payments are in cash, so designing features that incorporate cash payments into the online system would be absolutely essential.  With “two window banking” still in its infancy – successful ideas will need a test kitchen to eventually find their way into the conservative world of money, banking and payments.
		</h3>
			
		<h3>To account for imperfections in existing standards we believe its time we align bankers incentives with society's preferences for full employment and stable prices.  For this purpose, we propose “two-window” banking because it separates the functions of banks into those of utility (i.e. ensure the efficient functioning of payment mechanisms anywhere, anytime, from the palm of ones hands with 100% reserve of deposits) and those of riskier activities (i.e. lending). We believe capitalism could be stabilized by separating the provision of money, from the provision of finance, to contain the moral hazard brought on by deposit insurance and supervision alone.  While the right regulatory model for it all  is not yet known, one thing is clear. Aligning bankers incentives with society's preferences for resilient and reliable banking is absolutely essential. The future of "two window banking" lies in increasing its audiences, not its rigor.  Its success will be a result of its broad appeal among those not formally trained in money, banking and payments.

<p> Engaged psychology and art history to build a business model around my undergraduate research. Designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
