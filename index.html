		<h2>NEW ACTIVITIES, SAME OLD MISTAKES:  BEHAVIORAL TRENDS IN JUDICIAL STATISTICS & THE PROMISE OF 'PERSONALIZED RULE'</h2>

		<p>Imagine you are a judge.  It's easy when there is a precedent or statue on point; you follow it.  But what do you do when a new activity emerges and the rights and duties of the people engaged are unclear?  With the law unclear good judges cast their votes and opinions not on the basis of personal choices but of technical legal judgment.  This self restraint is a product of arduous legal training.  But given the vastness of law and its extension into all sorts of controversial areas it's inevitable some decisions will be based on personal choices.  Thankfully arduous legal training builds commitment to the courts and acts as a filter.  This training protects judges from serving up offensive judgment deprived of persuasion and reasoning, the kind of judgment that destroys our faith in law.  This is what makes the law work.</p>

		<p>This essay explores what makes the law not work.  We examine how as new activities emerge our court system has not developed sufficiently to handle this growing caseload satisfactorily.  Our basic claim is that federal courts provide too little capacity and that has unexpectedly led to the law not working as it should.  For that reason we take an interest in the causes and consequence of heavy caseload.  Some may conclude the silence around this topic is a consequence of the fact that no problem really exists.  We think a problem does exist and that is a different and more pressing problem than has been brought to focus in the past.</p>

		<p>This essay traces the relationship between judicial statistics, tax  income statistics and judicial behavior since 1990, via the caseloads of taxation and administrative law.  We explore relevant background law, aspects of the current situation, how this problem of heavy caseload came about and consequences of the current situation.  Our empirical research shows how heavy caseload has unexpectedly led to a discretionary approach to judging that causes judges to fail to recognize their duty of weighing considerations of social advantage around tax and administrative law.  Therefore we propose the courts be extended to include 'personalized rule' and 'specialized courts' to more clearly impose technical legal judgment.

<h2>Nooz</h2>
<p> We designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story. I engaged psychology and art history to build a business model and marketing plan around my undergraduate research.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
