		The Incompleteness of Law Around Digital Wallets: A Cross-Country Analysis	
		</h2>

		<p>It's the beginning of a new era in digital wallets and no one has the headlights to see beyond the fog of the present.  Especially with legal order as it is today, in which lawmakers have moved to general standards rather than specific rules, to apply legislation.  We see this approach to lawmaking almost like a faucet.  Rather than water, the published decisions - defining the circumstances of cases and the specific rules of legal obligation applicable in similar circumstances – switch on or off. 
		</p>

		<p>Though what is unique about these published decisions is that they are not explicit rules; instead they are merely the court's holding, that is, the minimum rule needed to explain the outcome of the case.  Though when pooled together these narrow court decisions –  a stream of holdings – form broader rules and standards.  This respect for prior published decisions with similar fact patterns is what the legal community calls a “precedent”. In simple terms, it's a past work of law that is called upon as reason for doing the same thing again.  
		</p>

		<p>We view the legal precedents derived from the decisions of courts are a problem rich environment.  Especially as new conditions arise not foreseen by the framers of existing precedents.  To our knowledge, the analysis of the precedents used to create rules of legal obligation around digital wallets has received little cross country analysis.  In this paper a mathematical analysis of certain properties of the many different policies and systems of digital wallets.  Given these circumstances it is also required to summarize contemporary advances in its law.  Methods will also be described for finding any number of precedents similar to a given precedent in all countries chosen for analysis.
		</p>

		<p>The methods taken may be described as follows:  with countless cooks – lawyers, judges and law clerks – adding precedents to this legal broth, crafting concise compete law becomes something of a confusing and inexact recipe.  It is for that reason we use the case citations appearing in judicial opinions as the basic data for our cross country analysis of digital wallet law.  Our analysis  translates its precedents into citations that represent rules and standards, and then interweaves those citations into a framework that pulls them apart with economic tools to summarize them for patterns.  The idea of analyzing judicial citation across countries may strike others as an overwhelming endeavor, poorly suited for statistical aggregation and irrelevant to an everyday person, but we believe the extensive research and writing that lawyers, judges and law clerks have devoted to understanding precedents shows the weight it brings to similar future legal obligations.
		</p>

		<p>Our notation is taken chiefly from symbolic logic.  Of the many systems in use we have chosen the simplest for out interpretation.  Some of the phrases, such as node, mesh, etc., are borrowed from ordinary network theory to mark the case citations appearing in judicial opinions.  This paper aims to demonstrate that designing law for digital wallets could be both a mathematical endeavor and painstaking social art.  Moreover, we offer a persuasive analysis of which precedents might be redundant and which might be most practical in a country's complex or unwieldy legal system.  Our idea is to influence the design of law that is coming into existence as well as law that won't be built for at least another generation.
		</p>

		<p>This paper is organized as follows. Part II describes a theory on the incompleteness of law. Part III describes ex ante versus ex post creations of the law and distinguishes between rules and standards.  Part IV summarizes major developments around the incompleteness of law and the evolution of digital wallets regulation.  Part V describes court case samples and tables summarizing principal characteristics of citations around digital wallets.  Within this section we also develop a framework for understanding how to use case citations to study the effects of details in law.  We then draw conclusions from the basic data of court case citations and apply it to the evolution of better cheaper digital wallet regulation.  The final part of this paper, Part VI, tests our theories with a reliable reproducible digital wallet as well as suggests areas for future research across other principles, precedents, methods and art.

<h2>Nooz</h2>
<p> We designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story. I engaged psychology and art history to build a business model and marketing plan around my undergraduate research.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
