		<h2>Push/Pull:  Using Law and Economics to Publicly Enforce Community Asset Trusts </h2>

		<br>

		<h3>When I was a teenager I operated a cash register.  At the end of the day the register told us how much money was supposed to have been collected on our shift.  If we made a mistake and the “take” was less than what the register said the deficit was said to have come out of our paycheck.  It left an impression that forever colored my reaction to the rules around money.   Over the years my skepticism around its rules and standards has only swelled.  It has left me with some stomach churning questions about money.  How do law makers and public agents (police, inspectors, tax auditors, prosecutors) work together to offer different rules, standards and legal regimes around money?  And how can we be relentless in luring new audiences to this topic? 
		</h3> 

		<h3>Major transformations and reforms around this money are occurring throughout the world, but they lack the realism and analysis an approach with law and economics would fashion.  We need nimble and wide ranging law economics foxes.  A deep understanding of the building blocks and institutional, economic and political structures of these problems helps foxes frame problems, and synthesize inputs across different perspectives, probe inter-linkages and anticipate shocks.  The purpose of this paper is to apply this law and economics framework to the development of regulation for digital wallets tied to community asset trust.  Our careful examination is a 2-level game that captures negotiations taking place domestically and internationally while incorporating different combinations of preferences, choices and constraints to expose the costs and benefits of each legal framework.  The goal is to better understand the “optimal” legal frameworks for allocating residual law making rights and design punishments that achieve optimal law enforcement when such contracts are incomplete.	</h3>

<p> We designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story. I engaged psychology and art history to build a business model and marketing plan around my undergraduate research.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
