<br>
<h3>I was born in Chicago</h3>
<h3>and raised along its lakefront.</h3>

<br> 

<h3>I am an aspiring graudate student in Law and Economics.
</h3>

<h3>My research concern the role of legal origin, legal diversity and investor confidence in stock markets.  I explore the social harm and address the hidden human costs of the law's uniformity among stock markets in transition, specifically since the pandemic.</h3>

<br>

<h3>I previously founded <a href="https://las.illinois.edu/news/2014-10-01/seeds-success">Nooz</a> to give context to breaking news back in the days of iphone 6
</h3>

<h3>After that I worked as a publicist and <a href="https://www.hogsalt.com/">cook</a> in Chicago's West Loop
</h3>



<h3>I then co-managed a staff of ten across two concepts for another hospitality group</h3>

<h3>Right now I'm preparing for graduate school</h3>

		<h2>STOCK MARKETS IN THE TIME OF COVID-19: THE LIMITATIONS OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL LAW
		</h2>

		<p>Imagine you are a regulator in charge of a country's stock market.  Your job is to nourish investor confidence.  But in an anxious world, where growth and prosperity can't be taken for granted, how do you nourish this confidence?  We understand regulating stock markets is hard.  The fact they exist at all is magical.  Globally speaking, the magic is rare. 
		</p>

		<p>The rarity of this magic is why regulators have warmed up to the “standard model”.  Its charms are understandable.  It offers: (1) investor protections and accounting practices “suitable” for an emerging shareholder class, (2) consensus that shareholders alone are the parties to whom company managers should be accountable, and (3) acceptance by a worldwide network of law firms, accounting firms and investment banks.  Such characteristics nourish investor confidence.  While the “standard model” may nourish investor confidence, it comes with costs.  It diminishes what is possible.
		</p>

		<p>Great artists fashion change using palettes covered with colors.  Governments fashion it using variations in their legal origins.  Robbing governments of this legal diversity is like taking colors from the artist.  It diminishes what legal evolution is possible.  This legal diversity helps stock markets evolve.  Without it, regulation governing the issuance, sale and trade of stocks, bonds and derivatives would struggle to evolve with the will of 21st century market forces.
		</p>

		<p>History has show stock markets, when left to their own devices, have proven fertile grounds for disastrously bad behavior.  It's troubling that the excitement of the games (i.e. the pandemic's stock market boom) and the charms of the “standard model” may have lulled some governments into thinking: (1) they have a reduced need for legal diversity, (2) they can copy-and-paste the “standard model”.   Ultimately, did this quick embrace of the “standard model” effectively create a spiderweb of mismatched regulation that set the stage for securities fraud?

<h2>Nooz</h2>
<p>Led a group of computer engineering, architecture and graphic design students on a machine learning 
project. Designed a slick mobile app for iOS and Android that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The real-time news results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to unfolding news stories.</p>
