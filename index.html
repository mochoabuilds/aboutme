		<h2>THE EFFECTS OF GROWING CASELOAD ON JUDICIAL BEHAVIOR AND 
		THE PROMISE OF 'PERSONALIZED RULE'</h2>

		<p>Imagine you are a judge.  It's easy when there is a precedent or statue on point; you follow it.  But what do you do when a new activity emerges and the rights and duties of the people engaged are unclear?  Good judges will make decisions not on the basis of personal choices but case facts, precedent and the philosophy of law.  Yet given the vastness of law and its extension into all sorts of controversial areas it's inevitable some decisions will be based on personal choices.  This is what makes judging difficult.  
		</p>

		<p>Thankfully the rule of law imposes it discipline on even the most heated issues.  It protects the courts from serving up offensive judgment deprived of persuasion and reasoning, the kind of decisions that destroy our faith in judicial systems.  Rule of law is what makes the law work.  	
		</p>

		<p>This essay explores what causes the law not to work.  We show how procedural practices in the federal courts don't support the judges as squarely as we'd like.  Our empirical research shows that heavy caseload has unexpectedly led to the law not working as it should and should therefore be extended to include 'personalized rule'.  
		</p>

		<p>To put readers in the right mindset to absorb and agree with our theory we must first show how the courts bear a heavy burden.  In recent years more than ##### applications for review have been filed in the federal court of appeals each year.  The pressure is staggering.  Pressures driving this heavy caseload include: 1) increases in new activities and the rights and duties of the people engaged in them; 2) increases in the number and significance of ties among people from all over the world; 3) increases in social legislation and regulatory provisions.  These factors have combined to produce an explosion of litigation beyond anything seen in the past.  
		</p>

		<p>The consequence of this is a collection of judges who work very hard on an individual basis, but with little authoritative guidance from their own circuit or higher courts.  The consequence of that is our system of precedent, on which common law is based, has lost much of its structure and influence.  In essence we now have an increasingly discretionary approach to justice.  With fewer binding precedents, judges now have an eye on creating a precedent rather than finding one. 
		</p>

		<p>With the law looking unsound, we wonder what the answer is.  To illustrate our theoretical argument further let's consider some scenarios.  Advances in competition, taxation, privacy, financial services, consumer protection or anything new, have the same basic operational problem in dealing with change: change tends to happen more quickly than judicial decisions cycles, and in parallel, change creates a heavier caseload for the courts.  We believe these scenarios cause judicial efficiency to become a primary weight put in the balance when making decisions.  The heavier the caseload, the heavier this weight grows.  Striking this balance is what makes judging difficult.  
		</p>

		<p>This heavier caseload coupled with a discretionary approach to justice causes the court of appeals to be badly overworked and not work satisfactorily.  We believe this combination promotes a lack of discipline among judges, said with great respect.  In our view, burdened by heavy caseload stemming from new activities, some judges would rather create a precedent than find one to shape the law of a case.  Our theoretical argument is that this discretionary approach causes the courts to fail to to recognize their duty of weighing considerations of social advantage around certain matters of law.
		</p>

		<p>What should be done?  To fashion some sort of solution to this problem we propose that cases of statutory Constitution be decided by 'personalized rule'.  We define this 'personalized rule' as precision law characterized by the features of individualization and machine-sorted information; and examples of cases of statutory Constitution to include questions of taxation and administrative law.  We chose these matters because they do not involve constitutional questions; and are not important in regards to civil liberties, national security or federal-state relations.  There's also been quite a few of these cases in recent years.  
		</p>

		<p>We understand the pain and time associated with heavy caseload.  We believe 'personalized rule' is uniquely suited to ease caseload around certain matters of tax and administrative law based on its core technology, which uses AI to provide a real-time ruling based on 
		relevant features which vary by person and which justify a multitude of 'personalized rules'.  Courts simply integrate its framework into their technology, and it handles the rest.  'Personalized rule' would ease the burden of heavy caseload and keep the judicial effort moving for the good of all.  Its value proposition becomes clearer once you consider how the courts of appeals is handling more rulings with a discretionary approach to justice.  'Personalized rule' could alleviate this issue of the courts discretionary approach causing them to fail to recognize their duty of weighing considerations of social advantage, especially around matters of tax and administrative law.
		</p>

		<p>Surprisingly, it turns out that few scholars have considered how heavy caseload, coupled with the way judges behave within the federal court of appeals, has unexpectedly led to the law not working as it should and why it should therefore be extended to include 'personalized rule'.  We believe such rule can better protect individuals from the destruction of unchecked self-interest by maintaining the rule of law and reputation for good judicial procedure.  We look to ease the courts heavy caseload while building up judicial infrastructure, and with it, confidence in the courts. Some may disagree with our theory and solution, and this essay explores why they are wrong.  We confront the other sides arguments and criticisms, and describe why the benefits of 'personalized rule'  outweigh its costs.  We show how 'personalized rule' has the potential to outperform discretionary enforcement practices and refine the states tax and administrative laws.  We also consider what will happen if our theory and solution is accepted.

<h2>Nooz</h2>
<p> We designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story. I engaged psychology and art history to build a business model and marketing plan around my undergraduate research.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
