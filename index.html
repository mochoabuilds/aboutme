		<h2>THE INCOMPLETENESS OF LAW AROUND DIGITAL WALLETS: A CROSS-COUNTRY COMPARISON</h2>

		<br>

		<h3>When I was a teenager I worked a cash register.  At the end of the day the register told us how much money was supposed to have been collected during our shift.  If we made a mistake and the “take” was less than what the register displayed the deficit was said to have come out of our paycheck.  The experience forever colored my reaction to the rules and standards around money.  It also left me with some stomach churning questions like:  1) how do law makers and law enforcement institutions (i.e.  police, inspectors, tax auditors, prosecutors) work together to deliver different rules, standards and legal regimes around money?  2) what is “good” corporate law, and how does “good” law around money evolve?  
		</h3> 

		<h3>We recognize that these questions are of great importance, but they remain of secondary importance to the problem of incomplete law around money.  The problem is good lawyers stay ahead of this incomplete law in ways that time after time again prove to be beyond the reach of existing law.  Our idea for “good” regulation around money is to make it self-enforcing to optimize the cost of its law enforcement.  To do this we call upon the tools of law and economics.  Its methods concern itself with how changes in the law change the way people behave.  
		</h3>

		<h3>In the first part of the paper we argue that law around digital wallets is inherently incomplete.  This has important implications for the design of its lawmaking and law enforcement institutions.  Our analysis sees this incompleteness of law almost as a sociology and engineering problem.   This approach helps us consider how institutional structures affect its framing so we can better suggest solutions.  For the sake of this paper we limit our analysis to digital wallets and the factors that drives its evolution of corporate law.   Within our analysis we:  1) explore the large quantities of statistical data readily obtainable concerning the activities of courts and judges on digital wallet;  2) address the evolution of contract and tort law in relations to misrepresentation of information;  3) examine how corporate law around digital wallets does not evolve in isolation, but in close interaction socioeconomic conditions and politics.
		</h3>

		<h3>In the second half of the paper we apply this law and economics framework to explore the “optimal” allocation of lawmaking and law enforcement under incomplete law, focusing on the legislature, regulator and courts as holders of these lawmaking rights.  To perform this analysis we devise a database to “test” competing propositions for digital wallets regulation by examining the status quo and where providers fall short.  Our database is drawn from a detailed mapping of the evolution of corporate law in ten jurisdictions since the beginning of digital wallets.  Identifying, categorizing, summarizing and sourcing legal requirements from digital wallet legislation across France, Germany, England and the United States drive the analysis.  We also include nations that have received their corporate laws either directly or indirectly from these four jurisdictions. Using six key legal indicators we identify patterns of legal change and capture the evolution of corporate law around digital wallets.  We are keenly aware that with this approach there remains a possibility that variables other than those we identify may explain the differences in outcome.  We also understand explaining the evolution of corporate structural, cultural and psychological norms seems to be just as important as identifying these six key indicators.  Either way, by comparing alternative systems we can understand better what makes each written rule and their enforcement work to better:  4) analyze the legislative response to the challenges posed by this evolving market;  5) discuss a regulatory framework of proactive enforcement around digital wallets.</h3>

		<h3>To ensure our theory on the incompleteness of law around digital wallets maintains its gusto we test our theory with additional sources of real world data.   We believe vibrant legal discourse requires a continual dialogue between theory and evidence.  However, with this approach comes the challenge of balancing complexity with simplicity.  While quantitative methods pull the field of law and economics towards dizzying heights of advanced math and statistics, not all sophisticated tools are necessary.   We believe the focus should remain on increasing audiences.  Such a focus will allow law and economics to extend its stronghold inform major pockets of law ripe for more informed attention.  To drum up this attention we create our own digital wallet tied to a community asset trust.  Our payment processing system seamlessly integrates a digital wallet into an automated clearing house (ACH) network to spare United States based merchants some of the 3% fee commonly charged by card networks for payment processing.  It also helps merchants enhance their customer experience, create operational efficiencies and drive growth.  We then funnel a portion of these cost savings for merchants into a community asset trust tied to compassionate social programs.  The goal is to analyze the challenges posed by this evolving market and discuss a regulatory framework for digital wallet's evolving forms.   With a continual dialogue between theory and real world data we can better test our theories and suggest new ones that can then be extended or rejected.  The hope is that this paper can add to the debates on inequality, democracy and governance around the evolving rules, standards around money. </h3>

<p> We designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story. I engaged psychology and art history to build a business model and marketing plan around my undergraduate research.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
