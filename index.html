<h2>hi there!
<h2> my name is michael</h2>
<br/>
<br>
<h3>I was born in Chicago</h3>
<h3>and raised along its lakefront.</h3>

<br> 

<h3>I am an aspiring graudate student in Law and Economics.
</h3>

<h3>My research concern the role of legal origin and legal diversity in stock markets.  I explore the social harm and address the hidden human costs of the law's uniformity among stock markets in transition, specifically since the pandemic.</h3>

<br>

<h3>I previously founded <a href="https://las.illinois.edu/news/2014-10-01/seeds-success">Nooz</a> to give context to breaking news back in the days of iphone 6
</h3>

<h3>After that I worked as a publicist and <a href="https://www.hogsalt.com/">cook</a> in Chicago's West Loop
</h3>



<h3>I then co-managed a staff of ten across two concepts for another hospitality group</h3>

<h3>Right now I'm preparing for graduate school</h3>

		<h2>STOCK MARKETS IN THE TIME OF COVID-19: A CASE OF LEGAL EROSION?</h2>

		<p>Like any kind of evolution, change requires diversity.  Artists create paintings using palettes covered with colors and governments fashion legal change using variations within their legal origins.  Robbing governments of this variation is like taking colors from the artist.  It diminishes what is possible.  If too much diversity is lost, little or no legal evolution is possible.
		</p>

		<p>This legal diversity helps stock markets develop.  Their laws and institutions are like tectonic plates that grate against each other.  The best way to minimize this friction is to encourage legal diversity and cognitive independence.  Yet among developing stock markets the interest or outright adoption of the “standard model” of shareholder corporate governance has reached fever pitch.  We believe this convergence on uniformity increases friction and erodes the legal base for future development of law.</p>>

		<p>So when did this convergence on the “standard model” begin?  Symptoms of this mental climate could already be found before the pandemic (Hansmann & Kraakman 2000).  Did the excitement of the games (i.e. the pandemic's stock market boom) lull stock markets of different legal origin into thinking the future of regulation lay in uniformity?  And are we moving to a period where legal risk has increased, especially in the world of stock markets, making legal diversity and cognitive independence even more valuable a commodity?

<h2>Nooz</h2>
<p>Led a group of computer engineering, architecture and graphic design students on a machine learning project. Our project was supported by grants from two universities. We designed a slick mobile app that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure 
index". The real-time news results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more 
personal quality to an unfolding news story. Seed Funding Perkins Coie LLP </p>
