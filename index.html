		<h2>designing cbdc with a cash-like privacy</h2>

		<h3>Before the panini hit cash was king.  But these days there are more cashless signs than ever at the register.  Sensing this shift governments around the world have been developing their central bank digital currency (cbdc) akin to cash.  Tho replicating the convenient properties of cash will be no easy task.  To pull off this hat trick central banks will need to design their cbdc with:  support for fully private payments, built in regulatory requirements for anti-money laundering and (at least) some privacy preserving features of cash.
		</h3>

		<h3>Right now many governments around the world are debating, analyzing and prototyping options for cbdc.  At the heart of my research is defining who will distribute this cbdc “closer to the ground”.  Whomever it is, will have an outsized influence in how digital money, banking and payments evolve at the local level.  My research aims to show how central banks stand to gain from choosing established essential retailers as the distributors.  Roles to be filled by a distributor include:  on-boarding accounts, exchanging fiat currency for cbdc, payments authorization, settlements and anti-money laundering compliance.  
		</h3>

		<h3>Ultimately my goal is to show how a network of established essential retailers could be the trusted entity central banks use to allocate and manage cbdc “closer to the ground”.  Sharing the core duties of money, banking and payments will give central banks more time to focus on their core duties of independent monetary policy.  My hope is to help governments around the world flexibly accommodate today's technology needs and regulatory requirements – and tomorrow's – policy goals.

<p> Engaged psychology and art history to build a business model for my undergraduate research. Designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news inflation pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
