		<h2>STOCK MARKETS IN THE TIME OF COVID-19</h2>

		<p>This paper examines investor protection laws (shareholder and creditor rights) and accounting practices and their impact on stock markets in transition during the pandemic using data from ## countries.  Our empirical research shows that the way in which legal origin is transplanted is a much more important determinant of the quality of investor protection laws and accounting practices than the supply of law from a particular legal origin.  To demonstrate this our ##-country data set checks the robustness of the “transplant effect” and impact of legal origin on the effectiveness of judiciary, rule of law, absence of corruption, risk of government expropriation, risk of contract repudiation and accounting standards.  Our results shows that legal reform strategy should aim at improving legality within stock markets by carefully choosing legal rules whose meaning can be understood in context, so citizens have an incentive to use it and demand that institutions enforce and develop law around it.  We also explore how countries such as Singapore, Taiwan and Portugal managed to reverse the “transplant effect” and provided us lessons for the design of stock market legal reform in a post-pandemic world.

<h2>Nooz</h2>
<p>I led a group of computer engineering, architecture and graphic design students on a machine learning project. Our project was supported by grants from two universities. We designed mobile software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure 
index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more 
personal quality to a breaking news story. Seed Funding Perkins Coie LLP </p>
