		<h2>THE INCOMPLETENESS OF LAW AROUND DIGITAL WALLETS:  A CROSS-COUNTRY COMPARISON</h2>

		<br>

		<h3>When I was a teenager I worked a cash register.  At the end of the day the register told us how much money was supposed to have been collected during our shift.  If we made a mistake and the “take” was less than what the register displayed the deficit was said to have come out of our paycheck.  This experience forever colored my reaction to the rules and standards around money.  It also left me with some stomach churning questions:  1) how do law makers and law enforcement institutions (i.e.  police, inspectors, tax auditors, prosecutors) work together to deliver different rules, standards and legal regimes around money?  2)  how could the tools of law and economics be used to answer the questions of:  what is good corporate law, and how does good law evolve?  We recognize that these issues are of great importance, but they remain of secondary importance to the problem of incompleteness of law around money, especially digital wallets.
		</h3> 

		<h3>As long as legal scholars and lawmakers have to worry about the consequences that incomplete law brings they'll call upon the tools of law and economics.  Its methods concern itself with how changes in the law change the way people behave.  In the first part of the paper we calls upon law and economics to ask bold questions concerning digital wallets.  We argue that around this topic is inherently incomplete and that has important implications for the design of its lawmaking and law enforcement institutions.  Our analysis sees the incompleteness of law almost as a sociology and engineering problem.  This approach helps us frame problems, consider how institutional structures affect its framing and better suggest solutions.  For the sake of this paper we limit our analysis to discussions around digital wallets and the factors that drives its evolution of corporate law.  Our empirical analysis focuses on:  1) exploring the large quantities of statistical data readily obtainable concerning the activities of courts and judges on this topic;  2) addressing the evolution of contract and tort law in relations to digital wallets across select nations;   3) examining how corporate law around digital wallets does not evolve in isolation, but in close interaction socioeconomic conditions and politics;  4) analyzing connections between a nations legal system and long term digital wallet growth.
		</h3>

		<h3>In the second half of the paper we apply this law and economics framework to the development of a regulatory framework.  We analyze the legislative responses to the challenges faced by the digital wallets market.  We explore the “optimal” allocation of lawmaking and law enforcement under incomplete law, focusing on the legislature, regulator and courts as holders of these lawmaking rights.  Using the tools of law and economics we show that the “optimal” allocation of lawmaking and law enforcement rights is determined by the degree and nature of incompleteness of law and the magnitude of the expected damage of harmful actions.  To perform this analysis we devising a database to “test” competing propositions for digital wallets regulation by examining legal change across select nations.  Our database is drawn from a detailed mapping of the evolution of corporate law in ten jurisdictions since the beginning of digital wallets.  France, Germany, England and the United States drive the analysis.  We also include nations that have received their corporate laws either directly or indirectly from these four jurisdictions.  We use six key legal indicators to identify patterns of legal change and capture the evolution of corporate law around digital wallets.  Yet there remains a possibility that variables other than those we identify explain the differences in outcome.  We understand explaining the evolution of corporate structural, cultural and psychological norms seems to be just as important as identifying these key indicators.  Either way the idea is to showcase how legal systems have largely similar laws on the books at onset, but subsequently follow different paths with different emphases.  The goal is to identify patterns of legal change across these jurisdictions.  Additionally our analysis strives to suggest how the incompleteness of corporate law around digital wallets involves a trade off between rigid and flexible laws.  We argue that striking a balance between both is essential for ensuring the adaptability of corporate law in an evolving market.

<p> We designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story. I engaged psychology and art history to build a business model and marketing plan around my undergraduate research.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
