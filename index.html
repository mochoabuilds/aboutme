		<h2>XYZ-TBD'S LEGAL PRECEDENTS (AND OTHER FACTORS): A THEORETICAL AND EMPRICIAL ANALYSIS </h2>

		<p>20th century laws don't always solve 21st century problems.  To solve the toughest challenges of our information age we need a deep understanding of the institutional, economic and political structures of these problems.  Careful examination will be a two-level game that captures negotiations taking place domestically and internationally while incorporating preference functions to better understand the optimal legal frameworks across different constitutional systems.  Our goal is to facilitate cooperation where mutual gains may not exist and traditional transfer payment options exhausted.  Such an approach will help us better address the incompleteness of law around xyz-tbd, create new precedents and better conserve law enforcement resources.</p>

		<p>Though what makes law incomplete?  Incomplete law is not self-explanatory and not designed to apply to large numbers for long periods of time.  And it's a conscious choice to write rules that are highly specific, but leave out actions result in similar harm.  This is troublesome in a 21st century environment where new opportunities for taking action and exploiting opportunities evolve constantly.  Good lawyers can stay ahead of others in this environment in ways that time after time again prove to be beyond the reach of existing law. For that reason there's a need to design incentive systems that make it easier to make precedents relevant to inquiry and better adapt rules flexibly over time with proactive law enforcement for emerging 21st century problems.
		</p>

		<p>What is a precedent anyways?  In simple terms, it's a past work of law that is called upon as reason for doing the same thing again.  Precedents allow people to use the legal system to resolve disputes, structure activities and turn to law enforcement to enforce these rules.  Good precedents enable imperfect courts to correct wrongs where existing law is incomplete, and help people anticipate more clearly how courts make decisions.  While a precedent does not “wear out” in a physical sense, it does depreciate over time with changing social and economic conditions.  To illustrate, a decision involving a crash between two horse drawn wagons is bound to lose some of its precedent value as wagons are replaced by 21st century driver less cars.  For that reason we explore the incompleteness of law around xyz-tbd and create new precedents to keep pace with 21st century problems.</p>

		<p>To our knowledge, the use of precedents (and other legal factors) to create rules of legal obligation has received little theoretical or empirical analysis.  Our analysis tests an economic approach to understanding how all influence a judge's decision.  Primary data we comb concerning the activities of courts and judges include precedents and case citations in judicial opinions. Secondary data includes judge ideology, persuasiveness of lower court opinion and the influence of law clerks.  While none play a direct role in the results of a case, they all influence a judge's decision.  Our model also explores the relationship between primary / secondary data and the changing demographics of a court systems geographic population.  The goal is explore at what demographics do different levels of court begin to grow inflexible regarding how frequently they reference precedents and citations outside their ideology?  Because of the uniqueness of our approach to analysis, we develop our model in more detail in sections that follow.</p>

		<p>The nature of 21st century problems – the incompleteness of law around xyz-tbd, creating new precedents and better conserving  law enforcement resources - causes society to underestimate how quickly change occurs once it reach an inflection point and begins accelerating.  While the public tends to view each legal action in isolation, our goal is to put these actions together to synthesize our changing ideologies.  While the idea of an analyzing the voluminous record of precedents, judicial citation practices and other legal factors may strike others as an overwhelming endeavor, we don't see that as the case.  It provides a unique window into the development of xyz-tbd's policy.  The extensive research and writing that lawyers, law clerks and judges devoted to discovering and explaining precedents are no lost cause, and would not have been undertaken if precedent (and other legal factors) did not enter consistently into the decision of cases.</p>

		<p>The challenge of this century will be to construct, for the society that is coming, institutions and laws that carry on stability.  Questions of 21st century problems and democracy must be at the core of our concern today.  This paper is organized as follows.  Part II describes a theory on the incompleteness of law.  Part III summarizes major developments around the analysis of precedents and other legal factors influencing a judge's decision. Part IV describes our case samples and presents tables summarizing the principles characteristics of primary and secondary data.  Part V formalizes our model and derives hypotheses.  Part VI empirically analyzes the court case samples and other legal factors to study precedent flows.  The final part of this paper, Part VII, suggests some areas for future research using the approach developed here.</p>

<h2>Nooz</h2>
<p> We designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story. I engaged psychology and art history to build a business model and marketing plan around my undergraduate research.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
