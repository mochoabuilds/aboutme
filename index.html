<h1>I'm Michael Ochoa.</h1>
<br>
<br> 
<br>
<h2>I'm a graduate student in Economics.</h2>

<h3>The first word people usually used to describe me is “calming”.</h3> 

<h3>The second word is “inquisitive”.</h3>

<br>

<h3>My curiosity about the world led me to investigate food culture, 
sustainability, advocacy, software design, public relations and much more</h3>

<h3>Most recently, I was the Interim Director of Marketing for <a href="https://www.goddessandgrocer.com/">Goddess Restaurant Group</a> with experience co-managing the flagship restaurant 
and wholesale bakery.</h3>

<h3>Before that, I was the Private Events Lead for <a href="https://www.hogsalt.com/">Hogsalt Hospitality</a> where I managed events end-to-end.</h3>

<h3>I've also worked as an Assistant Publicist in the West Loop where I 
gained comfort developing media-facing materials including messaging, 
blog-posts, press releases and reactive statements.
</h3>

<h3>And as undergraduate I was recognized as a <a href="https://las.illinois.edu/news/2014-10-01/seeds-success">software designer</a> by two universities for news software that saw giving context to breaking news as communal. Additionally, I was a Research Assistant for the South 
Chicago Black Mothers' Resiliency Project and Illinois Sustainable 
Technology Center.</h3>

<h3>Dubbed by colleagues as a “hospitable fellow”, I'm the kind of person who feels good by making other people feel good. I'm also incredibly 
passionate about accessible design, behavioral economics and causal 
inference.</h3>

<h3>I'm happy to tell stories in all formats, whether it be through writing, audio,video, photo, visual displays of quantitative information, social media posts or even illustrations. I'm best at combining multiple formats and working collaboratively to reach the widest audience possible.
</h3>

<h3>I says “yes” more often than “no” and constantly pushing myself to try new things. I'm currently completing my graduate studies in economics to improve my empirical skills.
</h3>

<br>

<h3>I also have a long standing warmth for 19th and 20th century art history.</h3>
<br>

<h2>Nooz</h2>
<p>Led a group of computer engineering, architecture and graphic design students on a machine learning project. Designed software for iOS and Android that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The real-time news results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to unfolding news stories.</p>
