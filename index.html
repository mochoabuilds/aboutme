		The Incompleteness of Law Around Digital Wallets: A Cross-Country Analysis	
		</h2>

		<p>	The future of technology is never particularly easy to discern.  Especially in a legal system such as ours, in which lawmakers prescribe general standards rather than specific rules to interpret and apply the published decisions of court systems.  Decisions produced by this process are unique in being implicit rather than explicit.  That is, they are the court's minimum rule needed to explain the outcome of the case, but these one-off decisions accumulate to form broader rules and standards.  The distinct characteristics of these rules and standards are what the legal community calls “precedents”.  In simple terms, it's a past work of law that is called upon as reason for doing the same thing again, and its inputs form the basis of judge-made rules of crystallized law. 
		</p>

		<p>The analysis of precedents used to create rules of legal obligation around digital wallets, to our knowledge, has received little cross country analysis.  This paper views these precedents as a flow of water.  Our focus is on measuring these flows and blending these measures with data on judicial citations to estimate and test hypotheses concerning the “drying up” of these flows (aka precedents).  We argue that precedents lose value over time due to changing socioeconomic conditions, legislation and judicial personnel as they reduce the flow of information  to a precedent.  We are devoted to creating a common language, empirical framework and discussion of the open problems around the incompleteness of law around digital wallets.
		</p>

		<p>The idea of a cross country analysis of judicial citations across countries may strike others as an overwhelming endeavor, poorly suited for statistical aggregation.  Though we believe the extensive research and writing that judges, attorneys, law clerks, court clerks, jurors, witnesses and litigants have devoted to understanding precedents shows the weight they bring to the decisions of similar cases.  The methods taken for measuring, estimating and testing hypotheses may be described as follows:  with countless cooks – lawyers, judges and law clerks – adding precedents to legal broth, crafting concise compete law becomes something of a confusing and inexact recipe.  It is for that reason we use the case citations appearing in judicial opinions as the basic data for our cross country analysis of digital wallet regulation.  Our analysis translates data on precedents into citations to represent rules and standards, and then interweaves those citations into a framework that further studies them with economic tools to summarize differences.  
		</p>

		<p>This paper is organized as follows. Part II describes a theory on the incompleteness of law. Part III describes ex ante versus ex post creations of the law and distinguishes between rules and standards.  Part IV summarizes major developments in the evolution of digital wallet regulation.  Part V describes our symbolic notation, court case samples and presents tables summarizing the principal characteristics of citations.  Within this section we also develop the framework for understanding how to use case citations to study the effects of details in digital wallet law.  We formalize our model, derive hypotheses and discuss the production of precedents and apply it to the evolution of less costly digital wallet regulation. The final part of this paper, Part VI, put our theories into action within a prototype digital and suggests areas for future research using the framework developed here.

<h2>Nooz</h2>
<p> We designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story. I engaged psychology and art history to build a business model and marketing plan around my undergraduate research.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
