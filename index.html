		<h2>TRENDS IN THE CASELOAD OF THE FEDERAL COURTS: THE PROMISE OF 'PERSONALIZED RULE' </h2>

		<p>Imagine you are a judge.  It's easy when there is a precedent or statue on point; you follow it.  Tho what do you do when a new activity arises, and the rights and duties of the people engaged are unclear?  Good judges will make decisions not on the basis of personal choices but facts, precedent and philosophy.  But given the vastness of law and its extension into all sorts of controversial areas it's inevitable some decisions will fall back on personal choices.  This is what makes judging difficult.  What should be done?  The best defense is for the courts, which encompass the judiciary, its staff and technological resources, to do their job well.  That is, articulate well-reasoned persuasive explanations for their judicial decisions.  This protects the courts from serving up offensive judgment deprived of persuasion and reasoning, the kind of decisions that destroy our faith in judicial systems.  Such a defense is what makes the law work.  
		</p>

		<p>This essay explores what causes the law not to work as it should.  To put readers in the right mindset to absorb and agree with our points we describe relevant background matters, and map show where the law is most unclear or in flux.  Such scenarios surface when a new activity arises (e.g. transportation by autonomous taxi) and the rights and duties of the people engaged are uncertain.  Those rights and duties will therefore be constructed by analogy to the rights and duties of people engaged in similar activities (e.g. transportation by taxi), but analogy is an inexact method for generating legal rules.  The resulting uncertainty generates litigation, in which the rights and duties of those involved in the new activity will be hashed out, reducing legal uncertainty and litigation in the next cycle.  However if the activity is changing (e.g. transportation by autonomous air taxi), the lull in litigation will create new legal uncertainty because the old precedents will not be perfectly adapted to the new legal activities, and so in the next period there will be more litigation again.  
		</p>

		<p>Of course judges follow the law in these scenarios, but judicial convictions inevitably play a role when the law leaves gaps. Thankfully the rule of law imposes its discipline when the law is in flux.  Still judicial efficiency will be one of the weights that judges put in the balance when making decisions.  The heavier the caseload, the heavier this weight will be.  This is what makes the law not work as it should.  We theorize sometimes the courts fail to recognize their duty of weighing considerations of social advantage when burdened by heavy litigation caseload.</p>

		<p>With the law looking unsound, we wonder what the answer is.  To illustrate our theoretical arguments let's once play the game of, imagine you are a judge...  Advances in technology are making the nation, and new areas of law around the world, a single market, thus increasing the problem of inter jurisdictional law externalizations. This may result in you to failing to recognize your duty of weighing considerations of social advantage when burdened by heavy caseload, especially in the most difficult areas â€“ those where the law is unclear or in flux.  
		</p>

		<p>Within this paper we find data that supports our theory that, during moments of heavy caseload, the law is applied quite differently from the way people assume.  Our basic claim is that heavy litigation cycles, coupled with the techniques of the federal court of appeals, has unexpectedly led to the law not working as it should, and should therefore be extended to include 'personalized rule'.  While a blunt solution, 'personalized rule' - defined as precision law characterized by the two primary features of individualization and machine-sorted information - could create additional capacity within the courts to better manage heavy caseloads within matters of advances in technology.   
		</p>

		<p>Surprisingly, it turns out that few scholars have considered how 'personalized rule' has the potential to outperform discretionary enforcement practices, and help judges better recognize their duty of weighing considerations of social advantage when burdened by heavy caseload.  May the law restrict this sort of harried judicial behavior, in the name of preventing insensitivity and head starts among populations?  May the law allow the courts to utilize new techniques to limit this practice?</p>

		<p>These questions are made relevant by our study.  We deconstruct data by time period, to see some complexities and sifts in data, in particular the growing difference between caseload and judicial behavior when burdened by heavy caseload to show the promise of 'personalized rule'; some may disagree, but this essay explores why they are wrong.  We confront the other sides criticism and arguments, with a focus on the costs of 'personalized rule' and why its benefits outweigh costs.  We believe some procedural practices in the federal courts don't support our claim as squarely as we'd like.  We explain how 'personalized rule' fills the gap.  We also consider what will happen if our theory, questions and basic claim is accepted.  We ask what the people who have to implement 'personalized rule' would have to do to make it work properly?</p>

<h2>Nooz</h2>
<p> We designed software that ran location-verified media through a model to construct a "news pressure index". The results, presented as thoughtfully designed visualization, transmitted a rawer, more personal quality to a breaking news story. I engaged psychology and art history to build a business model and marketing plan around my undergraduate research.  To make it happen I communicated design concepts and core interactions with engineers and designers I recruited to see what worked and how it could. </p>
