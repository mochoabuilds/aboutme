		<h2>offline payments (cbdc)</h2>

		<h3>A changeup in technology has slowed the flow of cold hard cash. For better or worse, cash now flows digitally and is the financial's systems oxygen.  When it flows freely, it does so unnoticed. When it stops, soon enough everything else does as well. Sensing this shift, central banks around the world have been testing their own supply of central bank digital currency (cbdc).  The aim to ensure gov currency remains relevant as payments turn increasingly digital.</h3>

		<h3>My graduate level research provides blueprints for embedding a no questions asked monetary instrument (stablecoin backed 1:1 w/USD) into a mobile interface along with supervisory and regulatory requirements (for offline payments and cross-border exchange).  I envision measure similar to physical cash employed to protect the security of cbdc in an offline setting.  My hope is to develop a product that is "present everywhere, but important nowhere".</h3>
