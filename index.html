<p>Developer Statement</p>
<br/>
<p> I'm a Chicagoan, with wide ranging interests. Trained as a sociologist before turning software development, I build technology with a more holistic approach, distinguished from the highly systemic and science-based theories used by many CS/ECE graduates. Instead I study the cultural, institutional and scientific conditions to better integrate code. My approach draws on lessons from history and applies them to real-world problems to harmonize or enhance day-to-day life. My goal is to bring fantasy and invention to software development (especially computer vision). </p>
<p>I see the possibilities of computer vision's mass production and have developed my own small factory, equipped with the latest machines and methods to streamline development. My current computer vision application is conceived as a piece of mini-architecture. The piece forges a link between the sinuous curves of the late 19th century's Aesthetic movement and Austrian architect Josef Hoffman. The software, hardware and design processes have yet to reach a natural end, but having more folks that look like the United States populations at the table is its design will be essential part.
