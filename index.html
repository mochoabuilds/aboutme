		<h2>cashless economies</h2>

		<h3>About two years ago cash was king. That is it was accepted most places.  But these days there are more cashless signs then ever.  With the flow of cold hard slowing governments around the world have been begun developing their own central bank digital currency (cbdc) akin to cash.  However this modernization requires a quite hat trick to complete. To pull it off a central bank will have to absorb and translate local norms, legal know-how and individual needs. Talk about building the plane as you fly it.</h3>

		<h3>At the heart of my research is defining who will distribute cbdb "closer to the ground". It's a mighty role as a distributor will have outsized influence in how digital money, banking and payments evolves.  At the moment, a distributors role includes: opening accounts, exchanging fiat currency for cbdc, handling local transactions, etc. My research argues that central banks stand to gain from choosing essential retailers as distributors.  Mainly because their products are services are largely resistant to socio-economic turbulance therefore always pulling traffic into the space. The goal is to show how a network of organized essential retailers could be a trusted network for allocating and managing cbcd "closer to the ground".
		</h3>

		<h3>From a more technical standpoint, my research focuses on the development of frameworks (i.e. submitting and banking local transaction claims for cbcd) and applications (i.e.  offline payments, digital welfare) that central banks can use to conceptualize their desired goals. The hope is to help governments best meet today's tech requirements - and tomorrow's - policy goals.</h3>
